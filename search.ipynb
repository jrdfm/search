He served two terms, from 2009 until 2017. The son of parents from Kenya and Kansas, Obama was born and raised in Hawaii. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review. After serving on the Illinois State Senate, he was elected a U.S. senator representing Illinois in 2004. In 2009, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He and his wife, Michelle Obama, have two daughters, Malia and Sasha. Quick FactsFULL NAME: Barack Hussein Obama IIBORN: August 4, 1961BIRTHPLACE: Honolulu, HawaiiSPOUSE: Michelle Obama (1992-present)CHILDREN: Malia and SashaASTROLOGICAL SIGN: LeoEarly Life and FamilyBarack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4, 1961, in Honolulu to Barack Obama Sr. and Ann Dunham. He has six half-siblings, including half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng who he grew up with.Obama’s ParentsObama’s father, Barack Obama Sr., was born of Luo ethnicity in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Obama Sr. grew up herding goats in Africa and eventually earned a scholarship that allowed him to leave Kenya and pursue his dreams of going to college in Hawaii.Obama’s mother, Ann Dunham, was born on an Army base in Wichita, Kansas, during World War II. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dunham’s father, Stanley, enlisted in the military and marched across Europe in General George Patton’s army. Dunham’s mother, Madelyn, went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, the couple studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through the Federal Housing Program, and after several moves, ended up in Hawaii.While studying at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Obama Sr. met fellow student Ann Dunham. They married on February 2, 1961, and Barack II was born six months later. As a child, Obama did not have a relationship with his father. When his son was still an infant, Obama Sr. relocated to Massachusetts to attend Harvard University and pursue a doctorate degree. Obama’s parents officially separated several months later and ultimately divorced in March 1964, when their son was 2. Soon after, Obama Sr. returned to Kenya.In 1965, Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, a University of Hawaii student from Indonesia. A year later, the family moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, where Obama’s half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng was born in 1970. Several incidents in Indonesia left Dunham afraid for her son’s safety and education, so at the age of 10, Obama was sent back to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents. His mother and half-sister later joined them.Obama struggled with the absence of his father, whom he saw only once more after his parents divorced when Obama Sr. visited Hawaii for a short time in 1971. “[My father] had left paradise, and nothing that my mother or grandparents told me could obviate that single, unassailable fact,” he later reflected. “They couldn’t describe what it might have been like had he stayed.”Life in HawaiiWhile living with his grandparents, Obama enrolled in the esteemed Punahou School. He excelled in basketball and graduated with academic honors in 1979. As one of only three Black students at the school, he became conscious of racism and what it meant to be African American. Obama later described how he struggled to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage with his own sense of self: “I noticed that there was nobody like me in the Sears, Roebuck Christmas catalog... and that Santa was a white man,” he wrote. “I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror with all my senses and limbs seemingly intact, looking as I had always looked, and wondered if something was wrong with me.”Obama’s Half-Siblings Obama’s family includes six half-siblings located around the world. He shares a mother with half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng and has five paternal half-siblings.According to Oprah Daily, he has maintained a warm and close relationship with half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng. The two grew up together and both graduated from the Punahou School. “He took his job as big brother seriously,” she said of Obama. “Our mother divorced my father, and our grandfather died. So he really ended up being the man of the house.” Soetoro-Ng campaigned for Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections, and the two have shared family vacations in Indonesia and Christmases in Hawaii.Obama’s oldest paternal half-sibling, Malik Obama, was born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1958, and the two didn’t meet until 1985. Malik told the Associated Press in 2004 he served as the best man at Barack’s wedding and vice versa. However, Malik notably criticized Obama’s presidency in 2016 and announced his support for Republican candidate Donald Trump in that year’s election. He attended the third presidential debate as Trump’s guest.Barack’s other half-siblings include: Half-sister Auma Obama, born 1960 in Nairobi. She and Barack met for the first time when they were in their 20s in Chicago.Half-brother Mark Okoth Obama Ndesandjo, born in Nairobi in 1965. He and Barack have met several times following their 1988 introduction in Kenya.Half-brother David Ndesandjo, born in 1967. Although it’s not clear when, he died in a motorcycle accident, according to Politico.Half-brother George Hussein Onyango Obama, born in 1982 in Kenya. Barack has only spoken to his youngest half-brother a few times. EducationGetty ImagesBarack Obama attends a dinner in honor of Black History Month at Occidental College in February 1981.Obama entered Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1979. After two years, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, graduating in 1983 with a degree in political science.After his undergrad studies, Obama worked in the business sector for two years. He moved to Chicago in 1985, where he worked on the impoverished South Side as a community organizer for low-income residents in the Roseland and the Altgeld Gardens communities.It was during this time that Obama, who said he “was not raised in a religious household,” joined the Trinity United Church of Christ. He also visited relatives in Kenya and paid an emotional visit to the graves of his biological father, who died in a car accident in November 1982, and his paternal grandfather. “For a long time, I sat between the two graves and wept,” Obama wrote. “I saw that my life in America—the Black life, the white life, the sense of abandonment I’d felt as a boy, the frustration and hope I’d witnessed in Chicago—all of it was connected with this small plot of earth an ocean away.”Returning from Kenya with a sense of renewal, Obama entered Harvard Law School in 1988. The next year, he met with constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe. Their discussion so impressed Tribe that when Obama asked to join his team as a research assistant, the professor agreed. In February 1990, Obama was elected the first Black president of the Harvard Law Review. He graduated magna cum laude with his juris doctor from Harvard Law School in 1991.Marriage to Michelle Obama and DaughtersIn 1989, while still in law school, Obama joined the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin as a summer associate. There, he met Michelle Robinson, a young lawyer who was assigned to be his adviser. Initially, Michelle refused to date Barack, believing that their work relationship would make the romance improper. However, she relented not long after, and the couple fell in love. Getty ImagesMalia, Michelle, and Sasha Obama at the 2008 Democratic National ConventionOn October 3, 1992, he and Michelle were married. They moved to Kenwood, on Chicago’s South Side. Barack and Michelle welcomed two daughters several years later: Malia, born in 1998, and Sasha, born in 2001. The couple has stated that their personal priority is their children. The Obamas tried to make their daughters’ world as “normal” as possible while living in the White House, with set times for studying, going to bed and getting up.Illinois Political CareerAfter law school, Obama returned to Chicago to practice as a civil rights lawyer with the firm of Miner, Barnhill & Galland. He also taught constitutional law part-time at the University of Chicago Law School between 1992 and 2004—first as a lecturer and then as a professor—and helped organize voter registration drives during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Obama’s advocacy work led him to run for and win a seat in the Illinois State Senate as a Democrat in 1996. During his years as a state senator, Obama worked with both Democrats and Republicans to draft legislation on ethics, as well as expand health care services and early childhood education programs for the poor. He also created a state earned-income tax credit for the working poor. As chairman of the Illinois Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee, Obama worked with law enforcement officials to require the videotaping of interrogations and confessions in all capital cases after a number of death-row inmates were found to be innocent.In 2000, Obama made an unsuccessful Democratic primary run for the U.S. House of Representatives seat held by four-term incumbent candidate Bobby Rush. Undeterred, he created a campaign committee in 2002 and began raising funds to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2004. With the help of political consultant David Axelrod, Obama began assessing his prospects for a Senate win.Illinois SenatorEncouraged by poll numbers, Obama decided to run for the open U.S. Senate seat, vacated by Republican Peter Fitzgerald. In the 2004 Democratic primary, he defeated multimillionaire businessman Blair Hull and Illinois Comptroller Daniel Hynes with 52 percent of the vote. That summer, he was invited to deliver the keynote speech in support of John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Obama emphasized the importance of unity and made veiled jabs at the George W. Bush administration and the diversionary use of wedge issues.After the convention, Obama returned to his U.S. Senate bid in Illinois. His opponent in the general election was supposed to be Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, a wealthy former investment banker. However, Ryan withdrew from the race in June 2004 following public disclosure of unsubstantiated sexual deviancy allegations by his ex-wife, actor Jeri Ryan. That August, diplomat and former presidential candidate Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan. In the November 2004 general election, Obama received 70 percent of the vote to Keyes’ 27 percent, the largest electoral victory in Illinois history. With his win, Obama became only the third African American elected to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction.Sworn into office on January 3, 2005, Obama partnered with Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana on a bill that expanded efforts to destroy weapons of mass destruction in Eastern Europe and Russia. Then, with Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, he created a website to track all federal spending. Obama also spoke out for victims of Hurricane Katrina, pushed for alternative energy development, and championed improved veterans’ benefits. 2008 Presidential Election and Inauguration In February 2007, Obama made headlines when he announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. He was locked in a tight battle with then-U.S. senator from New York Hillary Rodham Clinton. On June 3, 2008, Obama became the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee after winning a sufficient number of pledged delegates during the primaries. He campaigned on an ambitious agenda of financial reform, alternative energy, and reinventing education and health care—all while bringing down the national debt. Because these issues were intertwined with the economic well-being of the nation, he believed all would have to be undertaken simultaneously.On November 4, 2008, Obama defeated Republican presidential nominee John McCain, 52.9 percent to 45.7 percent, in the popular vote and won election as the 44th president of the United States. A historic victory, Obama would soon be the first Black president in the nation’s history.Getty ImagesBarack Obama is sworn in as 44th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts on January 20, 2009.Obama’s inauguration took place on January 20, 2009. When he took office at age 47, Obama inherited a global economic recession, two ongoing foreign wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the lowest-ever international favorability rating for the United States. During his inauguration speech, Obama summarized the situation by saying, “Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious, and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.”First Term as U.S. PresidentFirst 100 Days and Nobel Peace PrizeObama coaxed Congress to expand health care insurance for children and provide legal protection for women seeking equal pay. A $787 billion stimulus bill was passed to promote short-term economic growth in the face of the Great Recession. Housing and credit markets were put on life support, with a market-based plan to buy U.S. banks’ toxic assets. The government made loans to the auto industry, and new regulations were proposed for Wall Street. Obama cut taxes for working families, small businesses, and first-time home buyers. The president also loosened the ban on embryonic stem cell research and moved ahead with a $3.5 trillion budget plan.Obama undertook a complete overhaul of America’s foreign policy. He reached out to improve relations with Europe, China, and Russia and to open dialogue with Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba. He lobbied allies to support a global economic stimulus package. He committed an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan and set an August 2010 date for withdrawal of nearly all U.S. troops from Iraq. (Obama was an early opponent of President George W. Bush’s push to invade Iraq as part of the “war on terror” initiative, saying at an October 2002 rally: “I am not opposed to all wars. I’m opposed to dumb wars.”)In more dramatic incidents, Obama ordered an attack on pirates off the coast of Somalia and prepared the nation for a swine flu outbreak. He signed an executive order banning excessive interrogation techniques and ordered the closing of the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba within a year—a deadline that ultimately would not be met.In recognition of his administration’s early work, the Nobel Committee in Norway awarded Obama the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize.Related Story4 U.S. Presidents Who Won the Nobel Peace PrizeAffordable Care ActObama signed his signature health care reform plan, the Affordable Care Act, into law in March 2010. The new law prohibited the denial of coverage based on preexisting conditions, allowed citizens under 26 years old to be insured under parental plans, provided for free health screenings for certain citizens, and expanded insurance coverage and access to medical care to millions of Americans.Casually known as “Obamacare,” the hallmark legislation faced strong opposition from Congressional Republicans and the populist Tea Party movement even after its passage. In October 2013, a dispute over the federal budget and Republican desires to defund or derail the Affordable Care Act caused a 16-day shutdown of the federal government.The rollout of the reforms were initially bumpy. October 2013 saw the failed launch of HealthCare.gov, the website meant to allow people to find and purchase health insurance. Extra technical support was brought in to work on the troubled website, which was plagued with glitches for weeks. The health care law was also blamed for some Americans losing their existing insurance policies, despite repeated assurances from Obama that such cancellations would not occur.The legislation has faced numerous challenges in court and wound up at the U.S. Supreme Court three times. In June 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which required citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a tax. In a 5-4 decision, the court said that the health care law’s signature provision fell within the taxation power granted to Congress under the Constitution. In the summer of 2015, the Supreme Court upheld part of the Act regarding health care tax subsidies. Without these tax credits, buying medical insurance might have become too costly for millions of people.The latest Supreme Court decision about the Affordable Care Act began in 2017 when Congressional Republicans dropped the individual mandate tax penalty to zero. Texas and 17 other Republican states quickly sued to strike down the Affordable Care Act, mainly based on their opposition to its individual mandate. A Texas federal judge ruled in favor of the suit, saying that because there was no longer a tax, the law was unconstitutional. The case was sent to an appeals court. A final ruling came in June 2021 when the U.S. Supreme Court voted, 7-2, to uphold the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that the objecting states were not required to pay anything under the mandate provision and thus had no standing to bring the challenge to court. As of January 2023, nearly 15.9 million Americans were insured through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.Killing Osama bin LadenGetty ImagesPresident Barack Obama and members of his administration monitor the mission to locate Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House in 2011. On April 29, 2011, Obama approved a covert operation in Pakistan to track down infamous al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks who had been in hiding for nearly 10 years. On May 2, an elite team of U.S. Navy SEALs raided a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and, within 40 minutes, killed bin Laden in a firefight. There were no American casualties, and the team was able to collect invaluable intelligence about the workings of al-Qaeda.The same day, Obama announced bin Laden’s death on national television. “The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al-Qaeda,” Obama said. “As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not—and never will be—at war with Islam.”Repealing Don’t Ask, Don’t TellIn 2011, Obama signed a repeal of the military policy known as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which prevented openly gay troops from serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. He became the first president to voice support for same-sex marriage in May 2012. Second Term as U.S. President2012 Reelection and Second Term PrioritiesAs he did in 2008, during his campaign for a second presidential term, Obama focused on grassroots initiatives. Celebrities such as Anna Wintour and Sarah Jessica Parker aided the president’s campaign by hosting fundraising events. In the 2012 general election, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden faced Republican opponent Mitt Romney and his vice-presidential running mate, U.S. Representative Paul Ryan. On November 6, 2012, Obama won a second term as president, capturing more than 60 percent of the Electoral College. Obama officially began his second term on January 21, 2013, when U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office. In his second inaugural address, Obama called the nation to action on such issues as climate change, health care, the federal deficit, and marriage equality. Although he made progress on some of these fronts, he also faced waning public support—his approval rating hit a low of 38 percent in September 2014, according to a Gallup poll—and a divided government, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress for the final two years of Obama’s administration.NSA Wiretapping ControversyIn June 2013, after Edward Snowden shared confidential government documents with journalists, the news broke that the National Security Agency’s surveillance program was much broader than American citizens knew. Obama defended the NSA’s email monitoring and telephone wiretapping during a visit to Germany that month. “We are not rifling through the emails of German citizens or American citizens or French citizens or anyone else,” he said. Obama stated that the program had helped stop roughly 50 threats.However, the president suffered a significant drop in his approval ratings, to 45 percent, partially due to the revelations. In October 2013, German Chancellor Angela Merkel revealed that the NSA had been listening in to her cell phone calls. “Spying among friends is never acceptable,” Merkel told a summit of European leaders. ISIS AirstrikesIn late summer 2013, Obama was unsuccessful in his attempts to persuade Congress, and the international community at large, to take military action against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who had used chemical weapons against his country’s civilians. But there was interest in combatting the self-proclaimed Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which had seized large portions of Iraq and Syria and conducted high-profile beheadings of foreign hostages.In August 2014, Obama ordered the first airstrikes against the Islamic State on targets in Syria, though the president pledged to keep combat troops out of the conflict. Several Arab countries joined the airstrikes against the extremist group. “The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force,” Obama said in a speech to the United Nations. “So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.” Efforts to dismantle the Islamic State have continued after Obama’s presidency. As recently as April 2023, a top ISIS leader was killed in an airstrike. However, U.S. airstrikes have also been responsible for a large civilian death toll. As of December 2021, more than 1,400 people have died, according to military officials. Outside watchdog organizations, like Airwars, estimate the number of casualties could be as many as several thousand.Iran Nuclear Deal and Other Foreign DiplomacyIn September 2013, Obama made diplomatic strides with Iran. He spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the phone, which marked the first direct contact between the leaders of the two countries in more than 30 years. This groundbreaking move by Obama was seen by many as a sign of thawing in the relationship between the United States and Iran. “The two of us discussed our ongoing efforts to reach an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program,” reported Obama at a press conference.In July 2015, Obama announced that, after lengthy negotiations, the United States and five world powers had reached an agreement with Iran. The deal allowed inspectors entry into Iran to make sure the country kept its pledge to limit its nuclear program and enrich uranium at a much lower level than would be needed for a nuclear weapon. In return, the United States and its partners removed the tough sanctions imposed on Iran and allowed the country to ramp up sales of oil and access frozen bank accounts. That year, Obama also traveled to India and reached a civilian nuclear agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that opened the door to U.S. investment in India’s energy industry.Elsewhere, Obama moved to reestablish diplomatic ties with Cuba in December 2014. He and Cuban President Raul Castro announced the normalizing of diplomatic relations between the countries for the first time since 1961. The policy change came after the exchange of American citizen Alan Gross and another unnamed American intelligence agent for three Cuban spies. However, the long-standing U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, instituted by President John F. Kennedy, remained in effect. On March 20, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since 1928, as part of his larger program to establish greater cooperation between the two countries.Just prior to the trip, on March 10, 2016, Obama met at the White House with newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the first official visit by a Canadian leader in nearly 20 years. Obama’s Climate Change PoliciesIn August 2015, the Obama administration announced the Clean Power Plan, a major climate change policy that included the first national standards to limit carbon pollution from coal-burning power plants and called for more renewable energy from sources like wind and solar power. Ultimately, the plan never took effect after facing backlash and lawsuits from business groups, companies, 27 states, and Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who was then the Republican minority leader. In February 2019, the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, to block the plan by putting a hold on regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, mostly from coal power plants. That June, the Clean Power Plan was replaced by with the Affordable Clean Energy rule.Obama also worked to respond to climate change on the global level. In November 2015, he was a primary player in the international COP21 summit held outside of Paris that resulted in the Paris Climate Agreement. The agreement requires all participating nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit the rise of global temperatures and also to allocate resources for the research and development of alternative energy sources. Obama pledged that the United States would cut its emissions more than 25 percent by 2030. On October 5, 2016, the United Nations announced the Paris Climate Agreement had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries—including China and the United States, the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases—to allow it to take effect starting on November 4, 2016. But on June 1, 2017, President Donald Trump made good on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Supreme Court NomineesDuring his presidency, Obama filled two seats in the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor, who was confirmed in 2009 and is the court’s first Hispanic justice, and Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in 2010. Both justices were confirmed under a Democratic-majority Senate.After the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, Obama once again had an open Supreme Court seat to fill. In March, the president held a press conference at the White House to present 63-year-old U.S. Court of Appeals Chief Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for replacing the conservative stalwart. Garland was considered a moderate “consensus” candidate.Garland’s nomination was immediately rebuffed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others in the Republican Party. They stated their intention to block any nominee put forward by Obama, fearing that such a confirmation would tip the balance toward a more liberal-leaning court. Garland was never granted a Senate confirmation hearing, and the seat sat empty until April 2017 when Neil Gorsuch, nominated by President Donald Trump, was confirmed.Last Days in Office and Presidential LegacyOn January 19, 2017, Obama’s last full day in office, he announced 330 commutations for nonviolent drug offenders. The presidents granted a total of 1,715 clemencies, including commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the U.S. Army intelligence analyst who was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks.Over the course of his administration, Obama led the country away from financial catastrophe as the Great Recession gave away to market stability and a declining unemployment rate. He expanded the country’s diplomatic relations, and the Affordable Care Act marked the biggest health care expansion since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Although he made inroads on immigration reform through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the United States continues to face a broken immigration system. Obama also struggled to enact the gun control measures he hoped for, such as universal background checks and the resurrection of the federal ban on sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Some of the mass shootings during his time include at Sandy Hook Elementary School (20 children and six adult fatalities) in Connecticut; an Aurora, Colorado movie theater (12 fatalities); a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina (9 fatalities); and a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida (49 fatalities). Ever the optimist, Obama shared these parting words at his last press conference with the White House press corps: “I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad. I believe tragic things happen. I think there’s evil in the world, but I think at the end of the day, if we work hard and if we’re true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, that the world gets a little better each time. That’s what this presidency has tried to be about. And I see that in the young people I’ve worked with. I couldn’t be prouder of them.” Notable SpeechesGetty ImagesPresident Barack Obama delivers a speech in May 2011.2010 State of the UnionOn January 27, 2010, Obama delivered his first State of the Union speech. During his oration, Obama addressed the challenges of the economy, proposed a fee for larger banks, announced a possible freeze on government spending in the following fiscal year, and spoke against the Supreme Court’s reversal of a law capping campaign finance spending. Obama also challenged politicians to stop thinking of reelection and start making positive changes. He criticized Republicans for their refusal to support legislation and chastised Democrats for not pushing hard enough to get legislation passed. He also insisted that, despite obstacles, he was determined to help American citizens through the nation’s current domestic difficulties. “We don’t quit. I don’t quit,” he said. “Let’s seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.”2015 State of the UnionIn his 2015 State of the Union address, Obama declared that the nation was out of recession. “America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back... know this: The shadow of crisis has passed,” he said. He went on to share his vision for ways to improve the nation through free community college programs and middle-class tax breaks.With Democrats outnumbered by Republicans in both the House and the Senate, Obama threatened to use his executive power to prevent any tinkering by the opposition on his existing policies. “We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or re-fighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got to fix a broken system,” he said. “And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it.”2016 State of the UnionOn January 12, 2016, Obama delivered what would be his final State of the Union address. Diverging from the typical policy-prescribing format, Obama’s message for the American people was centered around themes of optimism in the face of adversity, asking them not to let fears about security or the future get in the way of building a nation that is “clear-eyed” and “big-hearted.” This did not prevent him from taking thinly disguised jabs at Republican presidential hopefuls for what he characterized as their “cynical” rhetoric, making further allusions to the “rancor and suspicion between the parties” and his failure as president to do more to bridge that gap.Farewell AddressOn January 10, 2017, Obama returned to his adopted home city of Chicago to deliver his farewell address. In his speech, Obama spoke about his early days in the Windy City and his continued faith in the power of Americans who participate in their democracy. He called on politicians and American citizens to come together despite their differences. “Understand, democracy does not require uniformity,” he said. “Our founders quarreled, and compromised, and expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity—the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.” Obama also appealed for tolerance along racial and ethnic lines and curbing discrimination: “After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves.“If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don’t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children—because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America’s workforce. Going forward, we must uphold laws against discrimination... But laws alone won’t be enough. Hearts must change.”He quoted Atticus Finch, the main character in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, asking Americans to heed the fictional lawyer’s advice: “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”Obama concluded his farewell address with a call to action: “My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you,” he said. “I won’t stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you’re young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president—the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change—but in yours.”Life After the PresidencyPete Souza//Wikimedia CommonsMalia, Michelle, Barack, and Sasha Obama outside the White House with their dogs Sunny and BoAfter leaving the White House, the Obama family moved to a home in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C., to allow younger daughter Sasha to continue school there.Obama embarked on a three-nation tour in late fall 2017, meeting with such heads of state as President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.National Portrait GalleryOn February 12, 2018, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled its official portraits of Barack and Michelle. Both rendered by African American artists, Kehinde Wiley’s work featured Barack in a chair surrounded by greenery and symbolic flowers, while Amy Sherald’s portrait of the former first lady depicted her in a flowing dress, gazing back at viewers from a sea of blue.Netflix Content and PodcastsIn May 2018, Barack and Michelle finalized a multi-year deal with Netflix to create exclusive content for the streaming service through their production company, Higher Ground. The fruits of the collaboration first appeared with the August 2019 release of American Factory, an Oscar-winning documentary about the 2015 launch of a Chinese-owned automotive glass factory in Dayton, Ohio, and the clash of differing cultures and business interests.The Obamas helped produce the 2020 documentary Crip Camp, which was nominated for best documentary feature at the 2021 Academy Awards. Higher Ground’s children’s series Ada Twist, Scientist and We the People each won awards at the inaugural Children’s and Family Emmy Awards in 2022.Higher Ground has expanded into podcasts, including Renegades: Born in the USA—a series of conversations between Barack and musician Bruce Springsteen about life, music, and their love for America.Barack Obama Presidential CenterIn May 2015, the Barack Obama Foundation announced plans to construct the Barack Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago. The complex would be home to a Chicago Public Library branch, a museum, as well as office and activity spaces for the foundation.In July 2016, Jackson Park was selected as the host site. Construction began in August 2021, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held the following month with Barack, Michelle, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot all in attendance.The project has been the subject of two lawsuits from volunteer nonprofit Protect Our Parks, which claimed the city and state of Illinois violated their public trust obligations to protect pubic land in approving the project. They were dismissed by a federal judge in 2019 and 2022, respectively.The project is expected to be completed by 2025, according to the Obama Foundation.Barack Obama Presidential LibraryIn September 2021, the Barack Obama Presidential Library announced plans to employ a virtual model with records available online, making it the first fully digital presidential library. According to the library, around 95 percent of the Obama administration’s Presidential records were born digital, including photos, documents, tweets, and emails. How Tall is Obama?According to White House documents, Obama’s physician measured him at 6 feet 1.5 inches tall during a 2016 physical exam.Books and GrammyObama published his autobiography, Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, in 1995. The work received high praise from literary figures such as Toni Morrison. It has since been printed in more than 25 languages, including Chinese, Swedish and Hebrew. The book had a second printing in 2004 and was adapted for a children’s version. The audiobook version of Dreams, narrated by Obama, received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word album in 2006.His second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, was published in October 2006. It hit No. 1 on both the New York Times and Amazon’s best-seller lists.The first volume of Obama’s presidential memoirs, A Promised Land, was released in November 2020.HobbiesBasketballGetty ImagesPresident Barack Obama shoots a basketball during the 2015 Egg Roll at the White House.Obama is one of the world’s most recognizable basketball enthusiasts. He played during his youth and for the junior varsity and varsity teams at the Punahou School, winning a state championship with the team in 1979.Unsurprisingly, Obama became a fan of the NBA’s Chicago Bulls during his time living in Chicago. He appeared in The Last Dance, a 2020 documentary profiling Michael Jordan’s career and final championship season with the Bulls in 1997-98.Obama was known for playing pickup games during his first presidential campaign and throughout his presidency, with opponents including NBA and WNBA players. According to GQ, Obama also had a basketball-themed 49th birthday party and invited stars like LeBron James, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, Magic Johnson, and Bill Russell to play for a group of wounded veterans at Washington’s Fort McNair.Obama also became famous for filling out NCAA men’s and women’s tournament brackets every year in a segment for ESPN called “Barack-etology.” He correctly picked the men’s March Madness champion only once during his presidency: the University of North Carolina Tarheels in 2009.In 2021, Obama joined NBA Africa as a strategic partner to help promote the league’s community efforts throughout the continent.Other HobbiesObama has said he grew up a huge comic book fan and was particularly fond of Spider-Man and Conan the Barbarian. He also told students at a 2015 virtual field trip that some of his favorite books included The Hardy Boys, Treasure Island, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings.As for movies and TV, Obama has cited the first two Godfather movies as his top films, and classics like Casablanca (1942), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) among his favorites. Obama is a fan of the HBO drama The Wire, as well as Mad Men, Entourage, Downton Abbey, House of Cards, and The Knick. According to a 2013 article, he is also a Star Trek fan and enjoyed watching live sports at the White House and aboard Air Force One. In addition to the NBA’s Bulls, Obama is also a fan of Chicago’s MLB team the White Sox.In terms of music, Obama told Rolling Stone in 2008 he had “probably 30” Bob Dylan songs on his iPod. He also said he listens to The Grateful Dead; Earth, Wind and Fire; Elton John; and The Rolling Stones. However, his favorite artist of all-time is Stevie Wonder.Obama isn’t totally old school; he follows contemporary media and releases a yearly list of his favorite books music and television from the prior 12 months.Movies About ObamaBarack and Michelle’s first date in Chicago was the focus of the 2016 romantic drama film Southside With You; Parker Sawyer played Barack.That same year, Netflix released the film Barry about Obama’s time at Columbia University.In August 2021, HBO released the documentary series Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union in conjunction with the former president’s 60th birthday. Quotes Our challenges may be new, the instruments with which we meet them may be new, but those values upon which our success depends, honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are old.We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what’s in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us.

Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.ArrowRightAt the lunch, held in late June at the White House residence, Obama promised to do all he could to help the president get reelected, according to two people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversation.That commitment was a welcome gesture for the White House at a time when Biden is eager to lock down promises of help from top Democrats, among whom Obama is easily the biggest star, for what is likely to be a hard-fought reelection race. The contents of the private conversation have not been previously reported.President Biden is seeking reelection. Here’s what you need to know about his candidacy. (Video: Blair Guild/The Washington Post)Obama was visiting the White House for what Biden aides described as a regular catch-up between the two men who served in the White House together for eight years. During their lunch, Obama made it clear his concerns were not about Biden’s political abilities, but rather a recognition of Trump’s iron grip on the Republican Party, according to the people.AdvertisementRecent polling suggests that Trump has a significant lead over his GOP rivals and that he and Biden are essentially tied in a hypothetical rematch.The White House said there was no specific agenda for the June 27 meeting, and people briefed on the conversation said the two presidents discussed a range of political, policy and personal matters, including updates about their families.Tensions linger between Biden, Obama campsObama, who remains highly popular among Democrats, is his party’s most sought-after surrogate, although his exact role in the 2024 cycle has not yet been determined. Obama aides say the former president is likely to reprise his playbook from recent elections.In 2020 and 2022, Obama held large rallies in swing states, hosted fundraisers for Biden and other Democratic candidates and cut ads in some of the most competitive congressional races. He also appeared in nontraditional settings aimed at connecting with young voters, such as ESPN’s Manningcast during “Monday Night Football,” collaborations with TikTok influencers and an interview during the NBA Finals.AdvertisementEric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama, declined to comment on the White House lunch, but he said Obama will tailor his campaign activity to maximize its effect.“We place a huge emphasis on finding creative ways to reach new audiences, especially tools that can be directly tied to voter mobilization or volunteer activations,” Schultz said in a statement. “We are deliberate in picking our moments because our objective is to move the needle.”Obama is slated to ramp up his political activity in the coming months, starting with a fundraiser later in August in Martha’s Vineyard to benefit the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. That group, launched by Eric Holder, who was attorney general under Obama, aims to combat Republicans’ success in drawing legislative and congressional districts.AdvertisementObama is expected to begin fundraising for Biden in the fall, a person familiar with the plans said.“President Biden is grateful for his unwavering support, and looks forward to once again campaigning side-by-side with President Obama to win in 2024 and finish the job for the American people,” TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement.Obama was in high demand for midtermsDuring lighter moments of their get-together, Obama and Biden discussed the current president’s intent to vacation at Sunnylands, a historic estate in Palm Springs, Calif. Biden had planned to stay there in August for part of his summer vacation, but the idea was scrapped because of concerns about extreme heat, according to a person with knowledge of his plans.Obama visited Sunnylands, the former home of publisher Walter Annenberg, multiple times during his presidency and hosted a number of foreign leaders there, including Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.AdvertisementBiden aides welcomed Obama’s early commitment to help the campaign, especially given the lingering frustration among some in Biden’s circle about Obama’s role ahead of the 2016 election. Obama made clear to aides at the time that he believed Hillary Clinton, not Biden, should be the Democratic nominee to succeed him.Obama even dispatched David Plouffe, one of his top political strategists, to reiterate for Biden the long odds he faced if he decided to run. “The president was not encouraging,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “Promise Me, Dad.”Some Biden aides were also frustrated that Obama declined to endorse Biden in 2020 until he had the Democratic nomination sewn up. But others say that before giving his public endorsement, Obama worked behind the scenes to ensure Biden’s nomination.And many senior Biden aides strongly rejected the notion of tension between the two camps, citing the heavy overlap among Obama and Biden staffers and noting Obama’s energetic involvement in the 2020 and 2022 elections.Advertisement“Well, there must have been an epic internal coverup operation because that supposed dynamic would be news to everyone who actually works for either person,” Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement. “No one has been a stronger supporter of the Biden-Harris Administration and its agenda than President Obama, his team, and veterans of the Obama-Biden Administration.”Biden enlists potential 2024 rivals as advisersAs he left the White House after the lunch in June, Obama completed his first task to help Biden’s reelection campaign: filming a short video to help the president with online fundraising.“Giving five or 10 bucks — whatever you can — to Joe Biden’s campaign makes a real difference,” Obama says in the video. “Let me tell you why, from a guy who’s won a couple of these. Donations from grass-roots supporters like you made up the majority of Joe’s campaign revenue last time.”Share CommentsSign upTOP STORIESPoliticsReporting and analysis from the Hill and the White HouseOpinion|It’s Putin, againBiden continues fundraising momentum, with a $53 million FebruaryTrump granted clemency to Medicare fraudsters before vowing to cut entitlement program abusebackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2024 The Washington Post', metadata={'source': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/02/obama-biden-campaign-reelection/'}),\n",

Mr. Obama dismissed the offer. Not good enough.Listen to This ArticleOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.The Chinese official erupted. “What do you mean that’s not good enough? Why isn’t that good enough?” he demanded. He referred to a past conversation with John Kerry, then a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. “I talked to Senator Kerry and Senator Kerry said that was good enough.”Mr. Obama looked at him evenly. “Well,” he replied, “Senator Kerry is not president of the United States.”That moment of sharp relief, a clash with an intransigent foreign apparatchik by a young American president feeling his own way, comes to life in a new oral history project on the Obama administration released on Wednesday. Six years after Mr. Obama left office, the project by Incite, a social science research institute at Columbia University, has assembled perhaps the most extensive collection of interviews from the era to date.Researchers interviewed 470 Obama administration veterans, critics, activists and others who were in the thick of major events back then, including Mr. Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, amassing a total of 1,100 hours of recordings. Transcripts of the interviews are being released in batches over the next three years, starting with a first set of 17 made public on Wednesday focused on climate change, a central issue then that continues to shape the national debate today.We are having trouble retrieving the article content.Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

It’s ambitious to name your debut novel “Great Expectations.” Regardless of the immediate reference to Dickens’ classic coming-of-age novel, you’re establishing high stakes for yourself. That said, go bold or go home? New Yorker magazine staff writer and theater critic Vinson Cunningham takes that risk with his highly autobiographical and vividly rendered novel, “Great Expectations.”After flunking out of college in Vermont, our narrator David is unmoored. In his early 20s, he’s lost the religion of his youth and has returned to his mother’s apartment “just south of Columbia University, in those blocks between 100th and 110th where the Upper West Side starts its soft melting into Morningside Heights.” He’s a young father, estranged from his daughter’s mother who also returned home from college to New York City. As David struggles to take classes at City University and hold down work as a tutor, his youthful potential feels like a memory. Despite all this, that shine is not entirely lost. Opinion Maurice Carlos Ruffin’s ‘The American Daughters’ boldly confronts the legacy of slavery The writer’s ambitious approach to the historical novel uses techniques reminiscent of “The Handmaid’s Tale” to examine the shifting meaning of freedom.March 4, 2024 At the book’s opening, David recalls: “I sat alone, hollering distance from the northern woods of Central Park, watching the Senator on TV.” He is watching the kickoff speech to Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. While Cunningham never uses his name, it’s clear from both the broad strokes as well as the details that this is the future 44th president. “He spoke before the pillars of the Illinois statehouse, where, something like a century and a half earlier, Abraham Lincoln had performed the same ritual,” observes David. “The Senator brought his elegant wife and young daughters on stage when he made his entrance. A song by U2 played as they waved.” Advertisement It’s with this launch that Cunningham begins to show two individuals poised to begin a great journey. For a period of time, their paths will entwine. Both men face unbelievable odds, and both stick to a course that leads to the White House. The book shares this heady tension of aspiration, charisma, optimism, unbelievable timing and intellectual curiosity as well as a yearning for connection. (Hogarth Press) David may be lost, but he’s not forgotten. “Despite myself, and not without some reservations, I find that I do believe in luck, in flukes, in the meaningless harmony of certain sequences,” he observes. “Take the one whereby I landed on the Senator’s campaign, only a month or so after watching his big speech.” Beverly, who “had once appeared on the cover of Black Enterprise magazine” and was board member of his high school, “where people still vaguely remembered and liked me,” has hired him as a tutor for her teenage son, after hearing that he had “strayed from the path.” Quickly sensing that David was overqualified and understimulated, Beverly offers him an irresistible opportunity. The Senator’s campaign was looking for “anybody young and competent,” and with questions that serve more as statements, she lands him an interview with the campaign which quickly leads to a job with the fundraising committee.This momentum steadily carries David through the book. Grounded in his thoughts, he’s a serious and considerate young man. His observations — of colleagues (“Everybody here dressed like a banker or a lawyer. I’d worn my boxy black suit with a slight shine at the elbows”), of donors (“I could tell this made him like me more. He’d helped make me”), of immigrants (“When I told him how much this guy has changed throughout his life, like walked him through how much effort this guy has put into himself — that’s what won him over”) — weave the story of a period of hope. In the wake of a campaign event introduction from Cornel West, David muses, not ironically, that “This candidacy was a rare instance of ‘radical love’ made real.” It’s funny to look back and say that 2007 was a simpler time, but 17 ragged years later, it’s easy to recognize that we live in a more cynical world. David’s journey brings us back to that moment through the encounters that maintained the campaign’s financial backbone.And yet, what’s compelling is that David’s innocence is not spotless. His rush to adulthood (lost opportunities, early fatherhood) forced him to see difficult truths. At his tender age, he yearns for the simplicity of religion and the church songs he sang with his late father, whose death (“in a small hospital downtown, where nuns stood watch over the political deaths of plague victims”) was shrouded in silence. After his death “the world kept rushing on. On the night of his funeral, I wrote a song.” Is it no wonder this is a person in need of a hero? Opinion What Dennis Rodman, Kate Moss and a 5,000-year-old Alpine iceman have in common Matt Lodder’s “Painted People: 5,000 Years of Tattooed History from Sailors and Socialites to Mummies and Kings” is a lively exploration of an underexamined art.Feb. 28, 2024 Gripped with this longing, Cunningham takes a cinematic, fast-paced story and infuses it with the texture of humanity. His ability to make art and find beauty in the smallest moments is the work of not just a skilled novelist but a soulful critic. Of Central Park, David muses, “It had always struck me as a place to be lost, experienced passage by passage, in a series of unfolding images — not something you could take in in one possessive glance.” Life, as well as fiction, is so often at its best when one surrenders to being lost. Though alchemy happens through an accumulation of details, life is lived in the moment.However, such keen, intimate details beg questions of access and research. A cursory glance at Cunningham’s biography reveals that he also worked on the Obama campaign as well as for the administration. Beyond that, his life shares considerable overlap with David’s. Such proximity to history leads you to wonder why Cunningham didn’t choose to write a memoir.But, again, there’s an expansiveness about fiction that elevates ideas and possibilities over a strict adherence to facts and truth. We could draw from our memories to resurrect a documentary-style recollection of the first Obama presidential campaign. Yet what surfaces from this novel is much more than the sum of its shimmering details, hence the benefit of working outside memoir. David echoes this reasoning, admitting: “I was less interested in the campaign’s plot than in how I was supposed to interpret it. Less in its details than in its coded total meaning.” Advertisement We too look at the coded total meaning that binds David to this journey. Cunningham’s attention to subtle, shared mysteries of life speaks more than a blow-by-blow analysis of this historical moment. The author cuts to the bone when David admits, “I wanted to be real in a way that history wasn’t, and realized, listening to the new president, that I didn’t yet know how, couldn’t fathom where to begin.” History is at its essence a collection of stories that speak to mythology, power and desire. When real life shifts into history, we lose a bit of ourselves. David — and Cunningham — explore the lives that coincide with history as Black men in America, as people endowed with faith, and as individuals who strive to surpass anyone’s wildest dreams.Lauren LeBlanc is a board member of the National Book Critics Circle.

From 1992 to 1993 Michelle was the assistant commissioner for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development, and in 1993 she founded the Chicago branch of Public Allies, a leadership-training program for young adults; she served as the branch’s executive director until 1996. Britannica Quiz First Ladies of the United States Quiz Barack was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, and that year Michelle became the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where she helped organize the school’s community outreach programs. In 2002 she became the executive director of community and external affairs for the University of Chicago. Two years later Barack was elected to the U.S. Senate and came to national prominence with a speech he gave on the final night of the 2004 Democratic National Convention.

She took leave from her position at the University of Chicago to devote herself more fully to campaigning while still maintaining time to care for her and Barack’s two young daughters. An adept speaker, she stumped extensively for her husband during the long Democratic primary race, and in June 2008 Barack became the party’s presumptive nominee. Michelle’s openness on the campaign trail and in interviews—she often humanized her husband by discussing his faults and implored observers not to “deify him”—endeared her to many. However, critics of her husband’s campaign took issue with some of her comments—such as when she remarked, while campaigning in Wisconsin in February 2008, that “for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.” Michelle later clarified her statement—saying that she meant to say that she was proud that Americans were eagerly engaging in the political process during the 2008 election—and she continued to have an active role in her husband’s campaign. Indeed, campaign aides referred to her as “the closer,” for her persuasiveness on the stump among uncommitted voters who attended rallies. On November 4, 2008, Barack was elected 44th president of the United States, defeating Arizona Sen. John McCain; he took office on January 20, 2009, and was reelected in 2012.Michelle ObamaMichelle Obama, 2013.(more)As first lady, Michelle was involved in various causes, notably supporting military families and ending childhood obesity. In an effort to promote healthy eating, she planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn of the White House in 2009. She related her experiences with the project in the book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America (2012). In addition to her work on such issues, Michelle also garnered attention for her fashion sense.During the 2016 presidential race, Michelle supported the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her speech during the party’s national convention drew widespread praise; noting the coarse tenor of the race, Michelle stated that “when they go low, we go high.” Clinton ultimately lost to Republican Donald Trump, who had repeatedly and falsely suggested that Barack was not a U.S.-born citizen.

(more)After her husband’s term ended in 2017, Michelle kept a relatively low public profile. However, in 2018 she released the autobiography Becoming, which garnered much attention and became one of the top-selling memoirs in the history of publishing. Although the book largely avoided politics, her criticism of Trump, whom she claimed endangered her family with his role in the “birther” conspiracy, drew particular interest. A tour for the book was the basis of the documentary Becoming (2020), which aired on Netflix; Michelle and Barack had signed a production deal with the media-streaming company in 2018. In 2020 she also hosted The Michelle Obama Podcast, which was available on Spotify, an Internet music-streaming service. Two years later Michelle published The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, in which she offered insights into handling difficult times, using her own personal experiences as examples.

Like 1.8M Share Save Tweet Donald Trump is still leading in Republican Primary polls despite his many legal troubles since his last presidency, no doubt due to his charismatic appeal amongst his own voter base. The businessman-turned-politician had a long list of snafus during his Presidency, but some of his missteps are agreed to be bipartisan comedic relief. Trump\\'s coinage of the word Obamna remains one such instance that has turned into meme fodder over the years; here\\'s how it happened. Where Does The Word \\'Obamna\\' Come From? While there are sporadic instances of internet users humorously misspelling former President Barack Obama\\'s name on the internet, it wasn\\'t until Trump\\'s fateful mistake during an October 2018 rally when the moniker grew famous. During the rally, which took place in Houston, Texas, Trump seemingly mispronounced Obama\\'s name as \"Obamna,\" perhaps mixing it up with the word \"amnesty\". The clarity with which Trump delivered and indeed paused on the word \"Obamna\" was the cause of much hilarity for onlookers regardless of their political views. When Was Trump\\'s Delivery Of The Word \\'Obamna\\' First Widely Recognized? Trevor Noah\\'s The Daily Show held a poll in early 2020 to decide which of Trump\\'s various missayings and gaffs were the funniest, with \"Obamna\" being one of the shortlisted words in the \"Best Trump Word\" bracket. How Is \\'Obamna\\' Used In Memes? The clip of Trump saying \"Obamna\" is often used in conjunction with another Presidential meme; one where Joe Biden appears to be saying Soda! @kalebfurst This is what the world needs !! 🥰 #positivity #positions #NoNuanceNovember #fyp ♬ original sound – Kaleb Furst TikTok videos combining these two memes began making the rounds in November 2020, with one meme creator pushing forth the solemn statement, \"No matter your beliefs, I found something we can all agree on\" followed by a clip of Trump saying \"Obamna\" and Biden saying \"soda.\" For the full history of the Obamna meme, be sure to check out Know Your Meme\\'s encyclopedia entry for more information.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images Obama told a story about America at his first inauguration 15 years ago. These people were there, and they still believe Analysis by John Blake, CNN 11 minute read Updated 1:12 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024 Link Copied! Barack Obama is sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts as the 44th president of the United States on January 20, 2009, in Washington. Mark Wilson/Getty Images CNN — Elizabeth Alexander was in her hotel room in Washington, DC, one frigid winter morning when she was awakened by a strange noise outside her window. She peered outside and saw a sea of people, bundled against the cold, walking in the predawn darkness towards the National Mall. It was January 20, 2009, and the crowds were on their way to witness the inauguration of Barack Hussein Obama, the nation’s first Black president. The sound she heard was their footsteps, marching almost in unison as their numbers grew, which sounded to Alexander like the “growing rumble of thunder or a crashing wave.” Alexander had a coveted hotel room near the Mall that day because she was a special guest of Obama’s. He had asked Alexander, an author and poet who was then a professor at Yale University, to compose and recite a poem for his inaugural. Upon reaching the inaugural platform, Alexander saw she was sharing the stage with dignitaries such as boxing legend Muhammad Ali, singer Aretha Franklin, author and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, civil rights icon John Lewis and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. When she stepped to the podium to speak, the temperature was around 30 degrees and the skies were clear and breezy. She began reciting her poem, “Praise Song for the Day,” an exhortation to “Sing the names of the dead who brought us here … who picked the cotton and lettuce.” And as she gazed out at the crowd of at least a million people gathered before her, Alexander saw something that was as inspiring as any poetic flourish she could conjure for the occasion. “When I looked out to the sheer infinity of people, it was a crowd to the naked eye without end,” she says today. “It was hugely multicultural. It went across ages, colors. It went across all visual types.” Elizabeth Alexander recites a poem during President Obama's swearing-in ceremonies at the US Capitol on January 20, 2009. Ron Edmonds/AP After finishing her reading, Alexander returned to her seat to watch Obama be sworn in. And then she heard something else after he completed his oath: The sound of some of the most powerful people in America choking back sobs. Are we a nation of January 20? Or of January 6? Today marks the 15th anniversary of Obama’s first inauguration. In the sweep of history 15 years is not that long, yet that event feels like it took place in another time, in another America. For a brief moment in that January sun, the US seemed like it had finally fulfilled the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream of reaching the “Promised Land.” Onlookers wept. People in countries as diverse as Russia, Japan, and Kenya cheered as they watched the ceremony on TV. It was a day that Alexander described as one of “euphoria” and “open-mouthed joy.” We now know what followed. “Hope and change” gave way to “Make America Great Again.” Racial and political divisions deepened. And on January 6, 2021, an overwhelmingly White crowd displaying symbols of White supremacist groups such as the Confederate flag tried to overturn President Donald Trump’s 2020 electoral loss by storming the US Capitol. As Americans look back on Obama’s first inaugural, it’s time to ask: Was the hope that so many — on the left and right — felt back then just a mirage, a fleeting glimpse of a flourishing multicultural America that can never be? Or will the future of America look more like January 6 than January 20? This is the question CNN put to Alexander and others who attended Obama’s first inauguration. How did they feel then? And looking back, what do they feel now about that day? Pro-Trump protesters gather in front of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC. A pro-Trump mob would storm the Capitol that day in an attempt to overturn Trump's 2020 presidential loss to Joe Biden. Jon Cherry/Getty Images The grim backdrop of Obama’s first inauguration Glance at images of the beaming crowd on the Mall that day, and it’s easy to forget how uncertain the mood was in the country. The Great Recession had devastated the economy. The American auto industry was on the verge of collapse. The US was embroiled in two seemingly unwinnable wars. Countless Americans were losing their homes and jobs. Commentators warned the country was on the brink of another Great Depression. Yet for many in the crowd, the mood was one of exaltation. Ed Wolf, then a senior at Rochester Institute of Technology, had come from upstate New York to watch the ceremony. The Metro was packed on the way to the Mall that morning, but he told CNN there was a glow of warmth and good cheer as strangers smiled at one another. Wolf said he noticed a dramatic shift in the mood of the crowd at one moment in the ceremony. It occurred when the new president took his oath of office, repeating his full name — Barack Hussein Obama — as protocol dictated. That moment seemed to validate the American Dream, the notion that anyone in the US could rise to the top regardless of their race, creed or class — even a man of color with a funny name. Former President Barack Obama waves after finishing his first inaugural address in 2009. He took office at a time of national peril: The Great Recession had devastated the economy and the US was embroiled in two wars. Alex Wong/Getty Images “When he said, ‘Hussein,’ the crowd around me just went wild,“ Wolf said in a recent interview. “It was like he was saying that he was proud of his name and his heritage and who he is. At that moment, you could feel the energy of the crowd.” Alexander, the poet, recalls another singular moment from that day. She sat on the inauguration platform next to a tall, stately Black man with a square jaw and white hair. He wore the same button that he had worn to the 1963 March on Washington. His name was Clifford L. Alexander Jr. and he was the nation’s first Black secretary of the Army and an advisor to several Democratic presidents. He was also Alexander’s father. He and her mother had taken Alexander in a baby stroller to the 1963 march when she was just a toddler. She had grown up in DC, and that inauguration day was a homecoming for her. As they sat together onstage, Alexander told him, “Don’t look at me, daddy.” “Because he would have made me cry,” she said recently with a laugh. “It was like, ‘Look straight ahead, man. We are staying composed for this.’” Former US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura are escorted to a waiting helicopter by President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle as the Bushes depart from the US Capitol after the swearing in of Obama as the 44th President of the United States. Tannen Maury/AFP/Getty Images At 12:07 pm, Obama walked to the podium. He, too, made a little nod to history. He marveled that “a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served in a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.” The crowd erupted in huge applause. Obama then told a sweeping story about America’s diversity that evoked his own upbringing as the son of a Black man from Kenya and a White woman from Kansas. He asked people to believe his presence that day was no fluke — it was a quintessential American story. “For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness,” he said. “We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture… and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve.” That day Obama talked about America’s diversity as a strength. But 15 years later, the question must be asked: How many people in a post-January 6 America still believe that? Today, some see America’s diversity as a weakness instead of a strength The United States’ de facto motto is E pluribus unum: Out of many, one. “We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people – our strength — from every country and every corner of the world,” President Ronald Reagan said during a 1989 White House medal ceremony. “And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.” But there seems to be a growing belief among some Americans that our country’s fabled diversity — its mix of races, ethnicities and immigrants — is in fact a weakness. Former President Trump recently said that undocumented immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.” Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, said last year, “Our diversity is not our strength. Our strength is what unites us across our diversity.” Former President Donald Trump speaks at a press conference at 40 Wall Street on January 17, 2024, in New York City. Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images In recent years “replacement theory,” a White supremacist belief which insists there is a conspiracy to replace Whites in America with non-White immigrants, has moved into the mainstream. Thomas Sowell, an economist and prominent Black conservative, has said there’s not “one speck of evidence” that diversity is America’s strength. “Is diversity our strength? Or anybody’s strength, anywhere in the world?” he wrote in a 2016 essay. “Does Japan’s homogeneous population cause the Japanese to suffer? Have the Balkans been blessed by their heterogeneity — or does the very word ”Balkanization” remind us of centuries of strife, bloodshed and unspeakable atrocities, extending into our own times?” While many felt euphoric watching Obama get sworn in on that sunny day in 2009, it’s now clear that there was a segment of White Americans who were experiencing another emotion: fear. Some Americans believe fear is a more potent political weapon than hope There is another question about Obama’s vision of the country that emerges in a post-January 6 America: Does fear mobilize people more than hope? Back then, Obama seemingly could have trademarked the word “hope.” One of his books is called “The Audacity of Hope.” A popular memento from his 2008 campaign was the Shepard Fairey portrait of Obama, emblazoned on posters and buttons with the word “hope.” His inaugural speech was full of nods to the concept. A Barack Obama supporter puts up posters showing one of the most popular images associated with Obama's first presidential campaign. Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis/Getty Images “On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord,” Obama said that day. “On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises.” A young man who stood just below Obama on the platform got a glimpse of that kind of hope Obama evoked. Michael Wear was then a faith advisor to Obama’s campaign. Today he is the author of the new book, “The Spirit of Our Politics: Spiritual Formation and the Renovation of Public Life.” In 2009, though, he was a broke college student who had volunteered for Obama’s campaign after running into him in a hotel lobby. Wear recalls a remarkable moment on the eve of the inauguration that validated Obama’s line in his speech about hoping someday that the “lines of tribe will dissolve.” At a dinner the night before, Obama honored his 2008 GOP presidential rival, John McCain, opening his remarks by calling McCain a hero. McCain, who had defended Obama’s patriotism and integrity during the campaign when a woman at a Minnesota town hall called him “an Arab,” in turn pledged to help Obama in the work ahead. “For his success will be our success,” McCain said. “Could you imagine that happening after any of the elections that we’ve had since Barack Obama has been in office?” Wear said. “Can you imagine this happening after the presidential election that we have coming up now?” US President-elect Barack Obama greets Arizona Senator John McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate, during a bipartisan dinner in McCain's honor on January 19, 2009, in Washington on the night before Obama's inauguration. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images While Obama built his campaign on hope, his successor Donald Trump’s inaugural address is best known for another phrase: “American carnage.” Trump evoked the scourge of poverty, drugs, street gangs and “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones” and said, “this American carnage stops right here and right now.” However, to claim this pessimism about America is confined to the right would be simplistic. Recent polls have shown a majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track. And there are those on the left who now say that hope is for suckers, that racism is built into the DNA of America and that White supremacy is a permanent feature of the country. One of the most influential writers on the left during the Obama era was Ta-Nehisi Coates. In a memorable 2015 essay, Coates wrote White supremacy will always be a force in America and that writers who write about “hopeful things” are committing to an idealism that’s been disproved by history. “‘Hope’ struck me an overrated force in human history,” Coates wrote. “‘Fear’ did not.” Others say it’s important to remember history’s moments of joy Even so, some who were at Obama’s first inauguration say his vision of America is still something worth believing in. “I’m sure that some people expected too much,” says Wear, the former Obama campaign worker, of Obama’s vision. “That doesn’t mean it was a mirage. The fact of the matter is, that (inauguration) day happened, and millions of people were there. And he (Obama) didn’t just win once, he won twice.” Wolf, the 2009 college student who is now an engineer in San Francisco, also says he still believes in Obama’s vision of America. One of his closest friends is a Republican who works in the Michigan legislature. “We have really good debates about what should happen and we disagree on fundamental issues,” Wolf says. “But the one thing we don’t disagree on is that we’re Americans, and we’re working for a better tomorrow.” US Democratic presidential candidate Illinois Senator Barack Obama supporters at a rally at Harbor Park in Norfolk, Virginia, October 28, 2008. Many Black Americans greeted his election with astonished joy. Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images When asked which January date —the 20th or the 6th — best represents America’s future, Alexander answered neither. “History is cyclical but it’s also very specific,” said Alexander, who is now president of the Mellon Foundation, one of the nation’s largest funders of the arts and humanities. “We’re never going to have a moment again where it’s the first African American president,” she said. But she said she hasn’t lost faith in her country, which she describes as this “gloriously complicated multicultural place.” “During the darkness of the Trump years, I would remind myself and my kids that all of the people who voted for Obama — we’re still here,” she said. Here is another way to remember that historic day in January. The author Rebecca Solnit once wrote that “action without hope is impossible,” and that remembering victories matter because that memory can become a “navigational tool, an identity, a gift.” Obama gives his inaugural address during his inauguration as the 44th President of the United States of America on the West Front of the Capitol on January 20, 2009, in Washington. Alex Wong/Getty Images “If people find themselves living in a world in which some hopes are realized and some joys are incandescent and some boundaries between individuals and groups are lowered, even for an hour or a day or several months, that matters, ” she wrote in “Hope in the Dark.” The Obama campaign signs have long ago been lost or stored away in basements and attics. Few people wear “Hope” buttons anymore. But perhaps the memory of that day 15 years ago will help people navigate the future. What will that future look like? We will have a better idea on another inauguration day — in January of 2025. In his inauguration speech Obama said he believed that this country would one day move past the “old hatreds” and that “the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve.” How many still believe that? For many Americans, the lines of tribe have only gotten deeper. But for some people who were at Obama’s first inaugural and experienced that “open-mouthed-joy,” the story of America is still being written. They still believe.

Getty The Affordable Care Act (ACA) made a splash when it landed in 2010, making more health insurance a reality for millions of uninsured Americans. Known colloquially as Obamacare, the ACA helps to provide low-income households with affordable health insurance, so they’re not forced to go without if sky-high premiums exceed their budgets.

The Affordable Care Act is known by a few names: ACA The more formal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Obamacare The amended Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act Enacted in 2010 and created under the Obama administration, the health insurance legislation goes well beyond a health insurance marketplace (at HealthCare.gov) and providing a health insurance option to people who can’t get coverage through an employer. The Affordable Care doesn’t allow health insurance companies to deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions or base costs on your health. The ACA exchanges offer subsidies based on income that help cut health insurance costs for Americans who qualify. The ACA also allows states to expand Medicaid to more people by lowering income requirements to get coverage. The ACA also features multiple other provisions, including: Prohibits lifetime monetary caps on health insurance plans. Forbids insurers from canceling health insurance unless there’s fraud. Doesn’t allow health insurers to deny coverage because of preexisting conditions. Requires that insurers use at least a minimum percentage of premiums to pay for members’ medical services. Allows parents to keep children on their health insurance until the age of 26. How Does Obamacare Work? The ACA helps people get health insurance who may not otherwise get coverage because of lack of workplace health insurance, their finances or preexisting conditions. People who have household incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level can receive premium tax credits to lower health care costs and make critical procedures and medications available. Here’s 400% of the federal poverty level by family size in 2023. 400% of the federal poverty level Family size Annual household income to be at 400% of federal poverty level 1 person $58,320 2 people $78,880 3 people $99,440 4 people $120,000 5 people $140,560 California additionally expanded tax credit eligibility to those up to 600% of the federal poverty level. Most states also expanded Medicaid, allowing more people to qualify for low-cost health insurance. Who Qualifies for Obamacare? To qualify for Obamacare you must meet these requirements: Live in the U.S. Be a U.S. citizen or national Not incarcerated Helping You Make Smart Insurance Decisions Get Forbes Advisor’s ratings of the best insurance companies and helpful information on how to find the best travel, auto, home, health, life, pet, and small business coverage for your needs.

ACA plans must cover these 10 essential health benefits, at a minimum: Ambulatory patient/outpatient services Emergency services Hospitalization Laboratory services Maternity and newborn care Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment Pediatric services, including oral and vision care for children Prescription drugs Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices The ACA requires health insurance companies to accept all applications for coverage. They can’t deny you based on pre-existing conditions and can’t charge more based on your health. Before Obamacare became law, health insurance companies could reject you for individual health insurance coverage or charge exorbitant rates if you had pre-existing conditions, which made it difficult for someone with health issues to find affordable individual health insurance. The ACA does allow health insurance plans to base Obamacare costs partially on age. For instance, a 30-year-old pays $412 monthly on average for an unsubsidized ACA plan. That’s compared to $469 for a 40-year-old, $655 for a 50-year-old and $994 for a 60-year-old. The health law also lets parents keep their children on their health plans until the children turn 26. They don’t have to live with you and they can be married but still be on your health plan. Pros and Cons of Obamacare The ACA expanded health insurance to millions of Americans and implemented vital coverage protections, but Obamacare does have drawbacks, namely it’s costs if you don’t qualify for tax credits and subsidies. Pros Comprehensive coverage that includes physicals, doctor appointments, vaccinations, surgeries, outpatient services and emergency care. Plans can’t deny you or charge higher rates based on your health. You can review health plans in your area and compare costs and coverages in one place rather than track down the information. ACA are the only health plans that provide premium tax credits and cost-saving subsidies based on your household income and size, which can decrease your costs. No coverage limits and out-of-pocket maximums mean you don’t have to worry that a health plan will stop covering you if you rack up medical bills. Parents can keep their children on a health plan until a child turns 26. Young children are eligible for vision and dental care coverage. Cons ACA plans are generally more expensive than other types of coverage, including group health insurance through an employer. You may have a limited number of health plan options depending on where you live. Some ACA health plans require that you get care only from in-network providers, which could be a problem if you sign up for a plan with a small provider network in your area. You can only sign up or make changes to an ACA plan during open enrollment unless you qualify for a special enrollment period. How Can I Get Obamacare? There are several ways to get Obamacare. Apply online. Create an account on HealthCare.gov and use the tools to find the best affordable health insurance plan for your family. Apply by phone. Call the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 for guidance and to enroll by phone. Apply by mail. When you mail a paper application, you can receive results within two weeks. Find an agent or broker. You can enter your ZIP code and find local help through the HealthCare.gov website. Use a partner. You can both apply and enroll in a new ACA healthcare plan when you use a certified enrollment partner, such as a health insurance company. How Does the Affordable Care Act Make Health Insurance Cheaper? The use of premium tax credits (PTCs) helps families pay for health insurance purchased via the health insurance marketplace. Only certain individuals qualify for the premium tax credit and must complete Form 8962 with their tax returns. Requirements to qualify for premium tax credits can include: Low household income or receive unemployment Tax filing status other than Married Filing Separately Be a victim of certain domestic abuse and spousal abandonment Not claimed as a dependent by another person Unable to get health insurance coverage via an employee-sponsored plan Not eligible for coverage through a federal program, such as Medicaid, Medicare or TRICARE What Are the Types of ACA Health Insurance Plans? There are four different “metal levels” of health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act: Bronze Silver Gold Platinum Each metal tier has different costs. Your exact costs vary by insurance company, where you live and other personal factors, such as your age. Bronze and Silver plans have the cheapest premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs. Gold and Platinum have higher health insurance premiums, but you pay less when you need health care services. Bronze and Silver make up the vast majority of ACA plans, with few Platinum plans offered. These are the average copays for Obamacare health insurance plans. Plan Insurance pays Patient pays Bronze 60% 40% Silver 70% 30% Gold 80% 20% Platinum 90% 10% You can determine which type of health insurance plan is best for you based on considerations like the coverage you choose, your ZIP code and your budget. When Is Open Enrollment for ACA Plans? Open enrollment begins every year on November 1 and ends on January 15 in most states for ACA marketplace plans. Some states with their own state exchanges, such as California and New York, may have longer open enrollment periods. During open enrollment, you can choose or change an ACA plan. Health plan offerings and costs often change each year, so it’s wise to compare your options annually to see if you can get better coverage for a cheaper price. The federal government and states announce their open enrollment periods in the fall. When Else Can You Sign Up for an ACA Plan? One of the biggest questions that people have is how to get health insurance, especially when it comes to Obamacare. There are certain instances when you may be able to sign up for Obamacare outside the yearly open enrollment period. Qualifying life events for life insurance allow you to get a special enrollment period when you can sign up for ACA health insurance outside open enrollment. This can include having a baby, getting married or losing your current health insurance coverage. You also may be able to enroll early based on your estimated household income. Some types of public health insurance don’t have open enrollment periods, so you can sign up for that coverage any time of year, as long as you qualify. This includes Medicaid, which bases eligibility on income and situation. For instance, states have income requirements, but may be more flexible with eligibility for children or pregnant women. The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is another health program for low-income Americans. CHIP doesn’t have open enrollment periods, so you can sign up any time of the year, if you’re eligible. When Else Can You Sign Up for an ACA Plan?

Find The Best Health Insurance Companies Of 2024 Learn More Affordable Care Act Health Insurance FAQ Does the ACA require that everyone have health insurance? Most Americans aren’t required to have health insurance. The Affordable Care Act initially required that nearly all Americans have health insurance, but Congress has since removed the penalty for not having it. A handful of states have their own health insurance mandate that requires residents to have coverage, including: California District of Columbia Massachusetts New Jersey Rhode Island Vermont What is the out-of-pocket maximum for ACA health insurance plans? ACA marketplace plans have out-of-pocket limits of $8,700 for single coverage and $17,400 for family coverage in 2022. That means you won’t pay more than that amount in a year in out-of-pocket costs, including premiums, deductibles, coinsurance and out-of-network care. Once you reach the out-of-pocket limit, the health plan handles 100% of the rest of the costs. Was this article helpful?

Obama’s mother, S. Ann Dunham, grew up in Kansas, Texas, and Washington state before her family settled in Honolulu. In 1960 she and Barack Sr. met in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii and married less than a year later.

      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is a law enacted in 2010 that has expanded access to health insurance for millions of Americans. It helps people get health insurance who may not otherwise get coverage because of lack of workplace health insurance, their finances, or pre-existing conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How does Obamacare work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The ACA helps people get health insurance through a health insurance marketplace (at HealthCare.gov). People who have household incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level can receive premium tax credits to lower health care costs and make critical procedures and medications available.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Who qualifies for Obamacare?**\n",
      "\n",
      "To qualify for Obamacare, you must meet these requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "Live in the U.S.\n",
      "Be a U.S. citizen or national\n",
      "Not incarcerated\n",
      "\n",
      "**What does Obamacare cover?**\n",
      "\n",
      "ACA plans must cover these 10 essential health benefits, at a minimum:\n",

      "Ambulatory patient/outpatient services\n",

      "Hospitalization\n",
      "Laboratory services\n",

      "\n",
      "**How can I get Obamacare?**\n",

      "\n",
      "**What are the types of ACA health insurance plans?**\n",
      "\n",

      "Gold\n",

      "\n",
      "Open enrollment begins every year on November 1 and ends on January 15 in most states for ACA marketplace plans. Some states with their own state exchanges, such as California and New York, may have longer open enrollment periods.\n",

      "**When else can you sign up for an ACA plan?**\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest questions that people have is how to get health insurance, especially when it comes to Obamacare.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certain instances when you may be able to sign up for Obamacare outside the yearly open enrollment period. Qualifying life events for life insurance allow you to get a special enrollment period when you can sign up for ACA health insurance outside open enrollment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can include having a baby, getting married, or losing your current health insurance coverage. You also may be able to enroll early based on your estimated household income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some types of public health insurance don’t have open enrollment periods, so you can sign up for that coverage any time of year, as long as you qualify. This includes Medicaid, which bases eligibility on income and situation. For instance, states have income requirements, but may be more flexible with eligibility for children or pregnant women.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is another health program for low-income Americans. CHIP doesn’t have open enrollment periods, so you can sign up any time of the year, if you’re eligible.\n"
