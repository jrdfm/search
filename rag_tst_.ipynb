He was a central figure in the 1905 Revolution,[4] October Revolution, Russian Civil War, and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Alongside Vladimir Lenin, Trotsky was widely considered the most prominent Soviet figure and was de facto second-in-command during the early years of the Russian Soviet Republic. Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist, his thought and writings inspired a school of Marxism known as Trotskyism.\\nBorn into a wealthy Jewish family in Yanovka in what was then the Russian Empire, Trotsky was initially a narodnik, but embraced Marxism soon after moving to Nikolayev in 1896. In 1898, he was arrested for revolutionary activities and exiled to Siberia, but in 1902 escaped to London, where he met Lenin and wrote for the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party\\'s paper Iskra. Trotsky initially sided with Julius Martov\\'s Mensheviks against Lenin\\'s Bolsheviks during the party\\'s 1903 split, but was non-factional from 1904. During the 1905 Revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia and became chairman of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was again exiled to Siberia, but escaped in 1907 and spent time in London, Vienna, Switzerland, Paris, and New York. After the February Revolution of 1917, which overthrew the tsar, Trotsky returned to Russia and joined the Bolsheviks. As chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, he played an important role in the October Revolution that overthrew the Provisional Government.\\nIn Lenin\\'s first government, Trotsky was appointed the People\\'s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and led the negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which Russia withdrew from World War I. From 1918 to 1925, he served as the People\\'s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, founding the Red Army; establishing conscription, training, and discipline; and leading it to victory in the Russian Civil War. In 1922, Trotsky and Lenin formed an alliance against the emerging Soviet bureaucracy;[5] Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his Deputy Chairman at the Council of People\\'s Commissars, but he declined the post.[6][7][8] During the New Economic Policy, Trotsky led the party\\'s Left Opposition, which advocated a programme of rapid industrialisation, voluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and expansion of workers\\' democracy. After Lenin\\'s death in 1924, Trotsky was outmaneuvered by Joseph Stalin and his allies and lost his positions: he was expelled from the Politburo in 1926 and from the party in 1927, internally exiled to Alma Ata in 1928, and deported in 1929. He lived in Turkey, France, and Norway before settling in Mexico in 1937.\\nIn exile, Trotsky wrote extensively and polemically against Stalinism, supporting proletarian internationalism against Stalin\\'s theory of \"socialism in one country\". Trotsky\\'s own theory of \"permanent revolution\" posited that the revolution could only survive if extended to advanced capitalist countries. In The Revolution Betrayed (1936), Trotsky argued that the Soviet Union had become a \"degenerated workers\\' state\" due to its isolation, and called for an end to Stalin\\'s bureaucratic dictatorship. He founded the Fourth International in 1938 as an alternative to the Comintern. In 1936, Trotsky was sentenced to death in absentia at the first of the Moscow show trials, and in 1940, he was assassinated at his home in Mexico City by NKVD agent Ramón Mercader. \\nWritten out of Soviet history books under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few of his rivals who never received political rehabilitation from later leaders. In the Western world, he emerged as a hero of the anti-Stalinist left for his defense of a more democratic, internationalist form of socialism[9]  against Stalinist totalitarianism and intellectual contributions to left-wing movements. Whilst some of his wartime measures have proved controversial and have been criticised along with his ideological defence of the Red Terror. Modern scholarship generally ranks his leadership of the Red Army highly among historical figures and he is credited for his major involvement with the military, economic, cultural[10][11] and political development of the Soviet Union.\\n\\n\\nChildhood and family (1879–1895)[edit]\\n8-year-old Lev Bronstein, 1888\\nLeon Trotsky was born Lev Davidovich Bronstein to David Leontyevich Bronstein (1847–1922) and Anna Lvovna (née Zhivotovskaya, 1850–1910) on 7 November 1879, the fifth child of a wealthy Jewish landowner[12] family in Yanovka, Kherson governorate, Russian Empire (now Bereslavka, Ukraine). His father, David Leontyevich, had lived in Poltava, and later moved to Bereslavka, as it had a large Jewish community.[13][14] Trotsky\\'s younger sister, Olga, who also grew up to be a Bolshevik and a Soviet politician, married the prominent Bolshevik Lev Kamenev.[15]\\nSome authors, notably Robert Service, have claimed that Trotsky\\'s childhood first name was the Yiddish Leiba.[16] The American Trotskyist David North said that this was an assumption based on Trotsky\\'s Jewish birth, but, contrary to Service\\'s claims, there is no documentary evidence to support his using a Yiddish name, when that language was not spoken by his family.[17] Both North and political historian Walter Laqueur wrote that Trotsky\\'s childhood name was Lyova, a standard Russian diminutive of the name Lev.[18] North has compared the speculation on Trotsky\\'s given name to the undue emphasis given to his having a Jewish surname.[17][18] The language spoken at home was not Yiddish [19] but a mixture of Russian and Ukrainian (known as Surzhyk).[20] Although Trotsky spoke French, English, and German to a good standard, he said in his autobiography My Life that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian.[21] Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.[22]\\nWhen Trotsky was eight,[23] his father sent him to Odessa to be educated. He was enrolled in a Lutheran German-language school (Realschule zum Heiligen Paulus or school of the Lutheran St. Pauls Cathedral, a school of Black Sea Germans which also admitted students of other faiths and backgrounds,[24]) which became Russified during his years in Odessa as a result of the Imperial government\\'s policy of Russification.[25] Trotsky and his wife Natalia later registered their children as Lutheran, since Austrian law at the time required children to be given religious education \"in the faith of their parents\".[26] As Isaac Deutscher notes in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man\\'s international outlook.[27]\\n\\nEarly political activities and life (1896–1917)[edit]\\nRevolutionary activity and imprisonment (1896–1898)[edit]\\nLev Davidovich Bronstein, 1897\\nTrotsky became involved in revolutionary activities in 1896 after moving to the harbor town of Nikolayev on the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea.[28] At first a narodnik (revolutionary agrarian socialist populist), he initially opposed Marxism but was won over to Marxism later that year by his future first wife, Aleksandra Sokolovskaya. In 1897, he graduated from his high school with a first class honours.[29] According to his relative, Valery Bronstein, his father had intended for Trotsky to become a mechanical engineer after leaving modern school.[30]\\nTrotsky briefly attended Odessa University studying engineering and mathematics.[2] He dropped out in early 1897 to help organize the South Russian Workers\\' Union in Nikolayev. Trotsky\\'s university colleague and a prominent engineer who served as the Technical Director of the Baltic Shipyard had noted that he displayed an exceptional gift for mathematics.[29][31] Using the name \"Lvov\",[32] he wrote and printed leaflets and proclamations, distributed revolutionary pamphlets, and popularized socialist ideas among industrial workers and revolutionary students.[33]\\nIn January 1898, more than 200 members of the union, including Trotsky, were arrested. He was held for the next two years in prison awaiting trial, first in Nikolayev, then Kherson, then Odessa, and finally in Moscow.[34] In the Moscow prison, he came into contact with other revolutionaries, heard about Lenin and read Lenin\\'s book, The Development of Capitalism in Russia.[35] Two months into his imprisonment, on 1–3 March 1898, the first Congress of the newly formed Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was held.[36] From then on Trotsky identified as a member of the party.\\n\\nFirst marriage and Siberian exile (1899–1902)[edit]\\nMain article: First exile of Trotsky\\nTrotsky\\'s first wife Aleksandra Sokolovskaya with her brother (sitting on the left) and Trotsky (sitting on the right) in 1897\\nWhile in the prison in Moscow, in the summer of 1899, Trotsky married Aleksandra Sokolovskaya (1872–1938), a fellow Marxist. The wedding ceremony was performed by a Jewish chaplain.[37]\\nIn 1900, he was sentenced to four years in exile in Siberia. Because of their marriage, Trotsky and his wife were allowed to be exiled to the same location in Siberia. They were exiled to Ust-Kut and the Verkholensk in the Baikal Lake region of Siberia. They had two daughters, Zinaida (1901–1933) and Nina (1902–1928), both born in Siberia.\\nIn Siberia, Trotsky studied philosophy.[38] He became aware of the differences within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known in Leninist phraseology as \"economists\" argued that the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot in life and were not so worried about changing the government.[39] They believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker\\'s struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper Iskra (The Spark), which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the Iskra position and began writing for the paper.[40]\\nIn the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife, Aleksandra, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in a load of hay on a wagon.[41] Aleksandra later escaped from Siberia with their daughters.[38] Both daughters married, and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents. Nina Nevelson died from tuberculosis in 1928, cared for in her last months by her older sister. Zinaida Volkova followed her father into exile in Berlin, taking her son by her second marriage but leaving behind a daughter in Russia. Suffering also from tuberculosis and depression, Zinaida committed suicide in 1933. Aleksandra disappeared in 1935 during the Great Purges in the Soviet Union under Stalin and was murdered by Soviet forces three years later.\\n\\nFirst emigration and second marriage

his surname to \"Trotsky\", the name he would use for the rest of his life. It is said he adopted the name of a jailer of the Odessa prison in which he had earlier been held.[43] This became his primary revolutionary pseudonym. After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining Georgi Plekhanov, Vladimir Lenin, Julius Martov, and other editors of Iskra. Under the pen name Pero (\"feather\" or \"pen\"), Trotsky soon became one of the paper\\'s leading writers.[14]\\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of Iskra were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by Plekhanov and the \"new guard\" led by Lenin and Martov. Plekhanov\\'s supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within Iskra, expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:\\n\\nI suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt \\'Pero\\' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number) and as an addition to our forces. \\'Pero\\' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works, in general, most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.[44]\\nBecause of Plekhanov\\'s opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But from then on, he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov\\'s enmity.\\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met Natalia Sedova (1882–1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, Lev Sedov (1906–1938) and Sergei Sedov (1908–1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons\\' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\\n\\nIn order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for \"citizenship\" requirements, took on the name of my wife.[45]\\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name \"Sedova-Trotskaya\".\\n\\nSplit with Lenin (1903–1904)[edit]\\nTrotsky in 1902\\nIn the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898, Iskra succeeded in convening the party\\'s Second Congress in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other Iskra editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with Iskra supporters handily defeating the few \"economist\" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the Jewish Bund, which had co-founded the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.[46]\\nShortly after that, the pro-Iskra delegates unexpectedly split into two factions. The split was initially over an organisational issue. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party where only party members would be seen as members, while Martov and his supporters, the Mensheviks, argued for a bigger and less disciplined party where people who assisted the party would also be seen as members. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.[47]\\nFrom 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a \"non-factional social democrat\". He worked between 1904 and 1917, trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. During these years, Trotsky began developing his theory of permanent revolution and developed a close working relationship with Alexander Parvus in 1904–07.[48]\\nDuring their split, Lenin referred to Trotsky as \"Little Judas\" (Iudushka, based on the character from Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin\\'s novel The Golovlyov Family),[49][50] a \"scoundrel\"[51] and a \"swine\".[52]\\n\\n1905 revolution and trial (1905–1906)[edit]\\nThe unrest and agitation against the Russian government came to a head in Saint Petersburg on 3 January 1905 (Julian Calendar), when a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in the city. This single strike grew into a general strike, and by 7 January 1905, there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg.[53]\\nOn Sunday, 9 January 1905, Father Georgi Gapon knowingly led a procession of radicals mixed within larger groups of ordinary working citizens through the streets to the Winter Palace to supposedly beseech the Tsar for food and relief from the government. According to Gapon himself, he led the people into a Palace Guard already on the defensive due to the crowd instigating violence against them. They eventually fired on the demonstration, resulting in the deaths of an unknown number of violent radicals, peaceful demonstrators and police caught within the melee. Although Sunday, 9 January 1905, became known as Bloody Sunday, Gapon\\'s own biography points to a conspiracy. This was later confirmed by Russian police records listing the number of known militant radicals found among the dead.[54][55]\\n\\nPolice mugshots of Trotsky in 1905 after Soviet members were arrested during a meeting in the Free Economic Society building\\nFollowing the events of Bloody Sunday, Trotsky secretly returned to Russia in February 1905, by way of Kiev.[56] At first he wrote leaflets for an underground printing press in Kiev, but soon moved to the capital, Saint Petersburg. There he worked with both Bolsheviks, such as Central Committee member Leonid Krasin, and the local Menshevik committee, which he pushed in a more radical direction. The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural Finland. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution.[57]\\nOn 19 September 1905, the typesetters at the Ivan Sytin\\'s printing house in Moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay. By the evening of 24 September, the workers at 50 other printing shops in Moscow were also on strike. On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers. On 7 October 1905, the railway workers of the Moscow–Kazan Railway went out on strike.[58] Amid the resulting confusion, Trotsky returned from Finland to Saint Petersburg on 15 October 1905. On that day, Trotsky spoke before the Saint Petersburg Soviet Council of Workers Deputies, which was meeting at the Technological Institute in the city. Also attending were some 200,000 people crowded outside to hear the speeches—about half of all workers in Saint Petersburg.[59]\\n\\nTrotsky in prison, awaiting trial, 1906\\nAfter his return, Trotsky and Parvus took over the newspaper Russian Gazette, increasing its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded, together with Parvus and Julius Martov and other Mensheviks, \"Nachalo\" (\"The Beginning\"), which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in 1905.[60]\\nJust before Trotsky\\'s return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had: an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital\\'s workers, the first Soviet (\"Council\") of Workers. By the time of Trotsky\\'s arrival, the Saint Petersburg Soviet was already functioning, headed by Khrustalyev-Nosar (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov). Khrustalyev-Nosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the Soviet.[61]\\n\\nHowever, since his election, he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks\\' original opposition to him. Khrustalev-Nosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the Saint Petersburg Soviet.[62] Indeed, to the outside world, Khrustalev-Nosar was the embodiment of the Saint Petersburg Soviet.[61] Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name \"Yanovsky\" (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar\\'s arrest on 26 November 1905, was elected its chairman. On 2 December, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts:[63] The autocracy never enjoyed the confidence of the people and was never granted any authority by the people. We have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of such loans as have been made by the Tsarist government when openly engaged in a war with the entire people.\\nThe following day, on 3 December 1905, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested.[64] Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. On 4 October 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to Siberia.\\n\\nSecond emigration (1907–1914)[edit]\\nTrotsky with Alexander Parvus (left) and Leo Deutsch (right) in Saint Peter and Paul Fortress prison at Saint Petersburg in 1906\\nWhile en route to exile in Obdorsk, Siberia, in January 1907, Trotsky escaped at Berezov[65] and once again made his way to London. He attended the 5th Congress of the RSDLP. In October, he moved to Vienna, Austria-Hungary. For the next seven years, he often took part in the activities of the Austrian Social Democratic Party and, occasionally, of the German Social Democratic Party.[46]\\nIn Vienna, Trotsky became close to Adolph Joffe, his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to psychoanalysis.[66]\\n\\nTrotsky reading Pravda in Vienna, circa 1910\\nIn October 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of Pravda (\"Truth\"), a bi-weekly, Russian-language social democratic paper for Russian workers, which he co-edited with Adolph Joffe and Matvey Skobelev. It was smuggled into Russia.[67] The paper appeared very irregularly; only five issues were published in its first year.[67]\\nAvoiding factional politics, the paper proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905–1907 revolution. Money was very scarce for the publication of Pravda. Trotsky approached the Russian Central Committee to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909.[68]\\nA majority of Bolsheviks controlled the Central Committee in 1910. Lenin agreed to the financing of \"Pravda\", but required a Bolshevik to be appointed as co-editor of the paper.[68] When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in Paris over Lenin\\'s objections,[69] Trotsky\\'s Pravda was made a party-financed \\'central organ\\'. Lev Kamenev, Trotsky\\'s brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910. Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing Pravda for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.[27]\\nThe Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912 and also called it Pravda. Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper\\'s name that in April 1913, he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the message was intercepted by the Russian secret police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin\\'s death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky\\'s opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin\\'s enemy.[14]\\nThe 1910s were a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP, leading to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of \"expropriations\",[70] i.e., armed robbery of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party. These actions had been banned by the 5th Congress, but were continued by the Bolsheviks.\\n\\nTrotsky in Vienna\\nIn January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction, led by Lenin, as well as a few defecting Mensheviks, held a conference in Prague and decided to break away from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and formed a new party, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In response, Trotsky organized a \"unification\" conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. \"The August Bloc\") and tried to re-unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks into one party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.[46]\\nIn Vienna, Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers, such as Kievskaya Mysl, under a variety of pseudonyms, often using \"Antid Oto\".[71] In September 1912, Kievskaya Mysl sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two Balkan Wars for the next year. While there, Trotsky chronicled the ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbian army against the Albanian civilian population.[72] He became a close friend of Christian Rakovsky, later a leading Soviet politician and Trotsky\\'s ally in the Soviet Communist Party. On 3 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, in which Austria-Hungary fought against the Russian Empire, Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral Switzerland to avoid arrest as a Russian émigré.[32]\\n\\nWorld War I (1914–1917)[edit]\\nThe outbreak of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism, redividing the party into defeatists and defencists. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions that saw defeat for your own country\\'s ruling class imperialists as the \"lesser evil\" in the war, while they opposed all imperialists in the imperialist war. These anti-war believers were known as \"defeatists\". Those who supported one side over the other in the war were known as \"defencists\". Plekhanov and many other defencist social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent and wanted them to win the war, while Trotsky\\'s ex-colleague Parvus, now a defencist, sided against Russia so strongly that he wanted Germany to win the war. In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the Swiss Socialist Party, prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, The War and the International,[73] and the pro-war position taken by the European social democratic parties, primarily the German party.\\n\\nLeon Trotsky with his daughter Nina in 1915\\nAs a war correspondent for the Kievskaya Mysl, Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) Nashe Slovo (\"Our Word\"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of \"peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered.\" Lenin advocated Russia\\'s defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the Second International.[74]\\nTrotsky attended the Zimmerwald Conference of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a Third International. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky\\'s resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.[75]\\nIn September 1916,[76] Trotsky was deported from France to Spain for his anti-war activities. Spanish authorities did not want him and deported him to the United States on 25 December 1916. He arrived in New York City on 13 January 1917. He stayed for over two months at 1522 Vyse Avenue in The Bronx. In New York he wrote articles for the local Russian language socialist newspaper, Novy Mir, and the Yiddish-language daily, Der Forverts (The Jewish Daily Forward), in translation. He also made speeches to Russian émigrés.[77]\\nTrotsky was living in New York City when the February Revolution of 1917 led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. He left New York on 27 March 1917, but his ship, the SS Kristianiafjord, was intercepted by British naval officials in Canada at Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was detained for a month at Amherst Internment Camp in Nova Scotia. While imprisoned in the camp, Trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates, describing his month at the camp as \"one continual mass meeting\".[78]\\nTrotsky\\'s speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of German officer inmates who complained to the British camp commander, Colonel Morris, about Trotsky\\'s \"anti-patriotic\" attitude.[78] Morris then forbade Trotsky to make any more public speeches, leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against Morris\\' order.[78] Back in Russia, after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers\\' and peasants\\' Soviets, the Russian foreign minister Pavel Milyukov was compelled to demand the release of Trotsky as a Russian citizen, and the British government freed him on 29 April 1917.[78]\\n\\nTrotsky arriving in Petrograd by train in May 1917\\nHe reached Russia on 17 May 1917. After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the Mezhraiontsy, a regional social democratic organization in Petrograd, and became one of its leaders. At the First Congress of Soviets in June, he was elected a member of the first All-Russian Central Executive Committee (\"VTsIK\") from the Mezhraiontsy faction.[79]\\nAfter an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in Petrograd, Trotsky was arrested on 7 August 1917. He was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary uprising by Lavr Kornilov. After the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the Petrograd Soviet, Trotsky was elected chairman on 8 October\\xa0[O.S. 25 September]\\xa01917.[80]\\nTrotsky sided with Lenin against Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev when the Bolshevik Central Committee discussed staging an armed uprising, and he led the efforts to overthrow the Russian Provisional Government headed by socialist Aleksandr Kerensky.\\nThe following summary of Trotsky\\'s role in 1917 was written by Joseph Stalin in Pravda, 6 November 1918.[81] Although this passage was quoted in Stalin\\'s book The October Revolution (1934),[81] it was expunged from Stalin\\'s Works (1949).[82]\\n\\nAll practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the President of the Petrograd Soviet. It can be stated with certainty that the Party is indebted primarily and principally to Comrade Trotsky for the rapid going over of the garrison to the side of the Soviet and the efficient manner in which the work of the Military Revolutionary Committee was organized.\\nAfter the success of the Bolshevik insurrection on 7–8 November 1917, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a counter-attack by Cossacks under General Pyotr Krasnov and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at Gatchina. Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other  moderate, socialist parties. \\nTrotsky was an outspoken advocate for a predominantly Bolshevik government and was reluctant to recall Mensheviks as partners after their voluntary withdrawal from the Congress of the Soviets. However, he released several, socialist ministers from prison and neither did Trotsky nor his colleagues in 1917 wish to suppress these parties. The Bolsheviks also reserved a number of vacant seats in the Soviets and Central Executive for the parties in proportion to their vote share at the Congress.[83]\\nAt the same time, a number of prominent members of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had assumed positions in Lenin\\'s government and lead commissariats in several areas. This included agriculture (Kolegaev), property (Karelin), justice (Steinberg), post offices and telegraphs (Proshian) and local government (Trutovsky).[84]\\nAccording to Deutscher, the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries presented a number of demands for a coalition government. These demands proposed disarming the Bolshevik detachments and excluding Lenin and Trotsky from the coalition. This was seen as unacceptable to even the most moderate, Bolshevik negotiators such as Kamenev and Sokolnikov.[85]\\nBy the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin\\'s top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading. This reversal of position contributed to continuing competition and enmity between the two men, which lasted until 1926 and did much to destroy them both.[editorializing]\\n\\nRussian Revolution and aftermath[edit]\\nCommissar for Foreign Affairs and Brest-Litovsk (1917–1918)[edit]\\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly on 6 January 1918. The Tauride Palace is locked and guarded by Trotsky, Sverdlov, Zinoviev, and Lashevich.\\nAfter the Bolsheviks came to power, Trotsky became the People\\'s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and published the secret treaties previously signed by the Triple Entente that detailed plans for post-war reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders. On 23 November 1917, Trotsky revealed the secret treaty arrangements which had been made between the Tsarist government, Britain and France, causing them considerable embarrassment.\\n\\nBrest-Litovsk[edit]\\nMain article: Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\\nLeon Trotsky and Lev Kamenev at the Brest-Litovsk negotiations (c. 1917–1918)\\nIn preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the Imperial German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers leading up to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Leon Trotsky appointed his old friend Joffe to represent the Bolsheviks. When the Soviet delegation learned that Germans and Austro-Hungarians planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, while the Baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by German princes, the talks were recessed for 12 days. The Soviets\\' only hopes were that, given time, their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt, so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote, \"To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying\".[86] Therefore, Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader of the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918.[87] At that time the Soviet government was split on the issue. Left Communists, led by Nikolai Bukharin, continued to believe that there could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist empire, and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace.[88][89]\\nThey cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary Red Army against Polish forces of Gen. Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki in Belarus, White forces in the Don region, and newly independent Ukrainian forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and asymmetrical warfare were used.[88]\\nThey were willing to hold talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, reparations, etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West. Still, they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who were then the Bolsheviks\\' junior partners in a coalition government.[90]\\n\\nTerritory lost under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\\nLenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the Imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky\\'s position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:[91]That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed Red Guard and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.\\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked land grab for territories. Trotsky wrote in 1925:[92]\\n\\nWe began peace negotiations in the hope of arousing the workmen\\'s party of Germany and Austria-Hungary as well as of the Entente countries. For this reason we were obliged to delay the negotiations as long as possible to give the European workman time to understand the main fact of the Soviet revolution itself and particularly its peace policy. But there was the other question: Can the Germans still fight? Are they in a position to begin an attack on the revolution that will explain the cessation of the war? How can we find out the state of mind of the German soldiers, how to fathom it?\\nTrotsky, in a letter he wrote to Lenin during the negotiations, which must have been written before January 18, 1918, described its policy, summarily, as follows:[93][94][95]\\n\\nDear Vladimir IlyichIt is impossible to sign their peace. They already have agreed with fictitious Governments of Poland, Lithuania, Courland and others concerning territorial concessions and military and customs treaties. (...)We cannot sign their peace. My plan is this:We announce the termination of the war and demobilization without signing any peace. We declare we cannot participate in the looting war of the Allies nor can we sign a looting peace. Poland\\'s, Lithuania\\'s and Courland\\'s fate we place upon the responsibility of the German working people.The Germans will be unable to attack us after we declare the war ended. At any rate, it would be very difficult for Germany to attack us, because of her internal condition. The Scheidemannites adopted a formal resolution to break with the Government if it makes annexationist demands of the Russian revolution.The Berliner Tageblatt and the Vossische Zeitung demand an understanding with Russia by all means. The Centrists favor an agreement. (...)We declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now (...)We must have your decision. We can still drag on negotiations for one or two or three or four days. Afterward they must be broken off. I see no other solution than that proposed. I clasp your hand.Yours,TROTZKY.Answer by direct wire: \"I agree to your plan\" or \"I don\\'t agree.\"\\nHowever, even though Lenin was in favor of a peace, due to party opposition, he basically responded with these messages from January 18, 1918:[96]\\n\\nMessage to Trotsky.Stalin has just arrived; we will look into the matter with him and let you have a joint answer right away.LeninPass the following on to Trotsky: please adjourn proceedings and leave for Petrograd.Send a reply; I will wait.Lenin, Stalin\\nAs it was remarked by Trotsky that, \"[... p]ossibly this answer already showed that he did not agree with my proposition (...)\", Trotsky returned to Petrograd to debate with Lenin.[97] During his debate with Trotsky, Lenin concluded: \"(...) In any case, I stand for the immediate signing of peace; it is safer.\"[98]\\nHowever, after debates with the German delegation, Trotsky and the Russian delegation withdrew from peace talks on 10 February 1918, by declaring ending the war on the side of Soviet Russia, and not signing a peace treaty.[99] Contrary to Russia\\'s declaration, Germany resumed military operations on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized, and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin\\'s proposal was accepted 7–4. The Soviet government sent a radiogram to the German side, taking the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.[100]\\nGermany did not respond for three days and continued its offensive, encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7–4 on 23 February 1918; the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.\\n\\nHead of the Red Army (spring 1918)[edit]\\nLeon Trotsky speaks from his armoured train during the Russian Civil War in 1920\\nOn 13 March 1918, Trotsky\\'s resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People\\'s Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs—in place of Podvoisky—and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over the controversial treaty of Brest-Litovsk.[90]\\nThe entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People\\'s Commissar (defence minister) Nikolai Podvoisky and commander-in-chief Nikolai Krylenko, protested vigorously against Trotsky\\'s appointment and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the Russian Civil War, and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky\\'s deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky\\'s side. The discontent with Trotsky\\'s policies of strict discipline, forced conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the Military Opposition, which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918–1919.[101]\\n\\nCivil War (1918–1920)[edit]\\nMain article: Russian Civil War\\n1918[edit]\\nAn antisemitic[102] 1919 White Army propaganda poster depicting Trotsky as Satan wearing a pentagram and portraying the Bolsheviks\\' Chinese supporters as mass murderers. The caption reads, \"Peace and Liberty in Sovdepiya\".\\nThe military situation soon tested Trotsky\\'s managerial and organization-building skills. In May–June 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions en route from European Russia to Vladivostok rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country\\'s territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the White Army after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.[103]\\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged mobilization, which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of political commissars into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the Imperial Army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:[104]\\n\\nAn army cannot be built without reprisals. Masses of men cannot be led to death unless the army command has the death-penalty in its arsenal. So long as those malicious tailless apes that are so proud of their technical achievements—the animals that we call men—will build armies and wage wars, the command will always be obliged to place the soldiers between the possible death in the front and the inevitable one in the rear. And yet armies are not built on fear. The Tsar\\'s army fell to pieces not because of any lack of reprisals. In his attempt to save it by restoring the death-penalty, Kerensky only finished it. Upon the ashes of the great war, the Bolsheviks created a new army. These facts demand no explanation for any one who has even the slightest knowledge of the language of history. The strongest cement in the new army was the ideas of the October revolution, and the train supplied the front with this cement.\\nAnother controversial feature of his military decisions was to inaugurate hostage-taking of relatives of ex-Tsarist officials working in the Red Army to avert the risk of defection or betrayal.[105] Service pointed out that this practice was exercised by both Red and White armies during the Civil War.[106]\\nTrotsky would later defend his decision and argue that none of the families of ex-officials who did betray the army and contribute to additional human casualties were themselves ever executed. He would also insist that had these draconian measures been adopted rather than excess “magnanimity” to opponents at the start of the October Revolution then Russia would have experienced far less casualties. [107] Deutscher draws attention to the fact that Trotsky preferred to exchange hostages and prisoners rather than execute them. He recounts that Trotsky had released General Krasnov on parole in 1918 after the Kerensky–Krasnov uprising during the initial stage of the civil war but the general would take up arms against the Soviets shortly again afterwards.[108]\\n\\nRed Terror[edit]\\nEuropean theatre of the Russian Civil War in 1918–19\\nArising after assassination attempts on Vladimir Lenin and Trotsky along with the successful assassinations of Petrograd Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky  and party editor V. Volodarsky,[109] the Red Terror was enacted. The French Reign of Terror has been viewed as an influence and a model for the civil war repressions.[110][12] The decision to enact the Red Terror was also driven by initial White Army massacres of \"Red\" prisoners in 1917, allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and the large-scale massacres of Reds  during the Finnish Civil War in which 10,00-20,000 workers had been liquidated by the Finnish Whites.[109]\\nIn his book, Terrorism and Communism: A Reply to Karl Kautsky, Trotsky argued that the reign of terror in Russia began with the White Terror under the White Guard forces and the Bolsheviks responded with the Red Terror.[111]\\nIn December 1917, Felix Dzerzhinsky was appointed to the duty of rooting out counter-revolutionary threats to the Soviet government. He was the director of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (aka Cheka), a predecessor of the KGB that served as the secret police for the Soviets.[112]\\nFrom early 1918, the Bolsheviks started physical elimination of opposition and other socialist and revolutionary fractions, anarchists among the first.[113] On 11 August 1918, prior to the events that would officially catalyze the Terror, Vladimir Lenin had sent telegrams \"to introduce mass terror\" in Nizhny Novgorod in response to a suspected civilian uprising there, and to \"crush\" landowners in Penza who resisted, sometimes violently, the requisitioning of their grain by military detachments.[114]\\nLeonid Kannegisser, a young military cadet of the Imperial Russian Army, assassinated Moisey Uritsky on August 17, 1918, outside the Petrograd Cheka secret police headquarters in retaliation for the execution of his friend and other officers.[115]\\nOn August 30, Socialist Revolutionary Fanny Kaplan unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin.[110][112]\\nDuring interrogation by the Cheka, she made the following statement:\\n\\n\"My name is Fanya Kaplan. Today I shot Lenin. I did it on my own. I will not say from whom I obtained my revolver. I will give no details. I had resolved to kill Lenin long ago. I consider him a traitor to the Revolution. I was exiled to Akatui for participating in an assassination attempt against a Tsarist official in Kiev [now Kyiv]. I spent 11 years at hard labour. After the Revolution, I was freed. I favoured the Constituent Assembly and am still for it\".[116]\\nIn September 1918, Trotsky rushed back from the far-eastern front of the civil war to reach Moscow after the second day of the shooting and Stalin remained in Tsaritsyn.[117]\\nKaplan referenced the Bolsheviks\\' growing authoritarianism, citing their forcible shutdown of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, the elections to which they had lost. When it became clear that Kaplan would not implicate any accomplices, she was executed in Alexander Garden. The order was carried out by the commander of the Kremlin, the former Baltic sailor P. D. Malkov and a group of Latvian Bolsheviks[118][page\\xa0needed][non-primary source needed] on September 3, 1918, with a bullet to the back of the head.[119] Her corpse was bundled into a barrel and set alight. The order came from Yakov Sverdlov, who only six weeks earlier had ordered the murder of the Tsar and his family.[120][121]:\\u200a442\\u200a\\n\\nThese events persuaded the government to heed Dzerzhinsky\\'s lobbying for greater terror against opposition. The campaign of mass repressions would officially begin thereafter.[110][112] The Red Terror is considered to have officially begun between 17 and 30 August 1918.[110][112] Regarding the Red Terror Trotsky wrote:The bourgeoisie today is a falling class... We are forced to tear it off, to chop it away. The Red Terror is a weapon utilized against a class, doomed to destruction, which does not wish to perish. If the White Terror can only retard the historical rise of the proletariat, the Red Terror hastens the destruction of the bourgeoisie.[122]\\nDesertions[edit]\\nMain article: Desertions\\nIn dealing with deserters, Trotsky often appealed to them politically, arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.\\n\\nIn the provinces of Kaluga, Voronezh, and Ryazan, tens of thousands of young peasants had failed to answer the first recruiting summons by the Soviets ... The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. \"Something might happen,\" they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. \"Comrade-deserters—come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you.\" They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The \"comrade-deserters\" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: \"What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?\" Later on, regiments of Ryazan \"deserters\" fought well at the fronts.\\nThe first use of the punitive barrier troops by the Red Army occurred in the late summer and fall of 1918 in the Eastern front during the Russian Civil War, when People\\'s Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs (War Commissar) Leon Trotsky of the Communist Bolshevik government authorized Mikhail Tukhachevsky, the commander of the 1st Army, to station blocking detachments behind unreliable Red Army infantry regiments in the 1st Red Army, with orders to shoot if front-line troops either deserted or retreated without permission. The barrier troops comprised personnel drawn from Cheka punitive detachments or from regular Red Army infantry regiments.[123]\\n\\nIn December 1918 Trotsky ordered that detachments of additional barrier troops be raised for attachment to each infantry formation in the Red Army. On December 18 he cabled: How do things stand with the blocking units? As far as I am aware they have not been included in our establishment and it appears they have no personnel. It is absolutely essential that we have at least an embryonic network of blocking units and that we work out a procedure for bringing them up to strength and deploying them.[123] The barrier troops were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the Red Army, a role which soon earned them the hatred of the Russian civilian population.[124]\\nTrotsky with Demyan Bedny near Kazan, 1918\\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:When Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us! We have no other bricks! And so, we must compel the bourgeois experts, under the leadership of the proletariat, to build up our edifice with these bricks. This is what is difficult; but this is the pledge of victory.[125]\\nTrotsky with Lenin and Kamenev\\nIn September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing continuous military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the Latvian Riflemen, Ioakim Vatsetis (a.k.a. Jukums Vācietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations of the army. At the same time, Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky\\'s adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict, this time between Trotsky and Stalin, in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general Pavel Pavlovich Sytin to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled[by whom?] from the front. Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.\\nIn 1919, 616 \"hardcore\" deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following Trotsky\\'s dracionan measures.[126] According to historian Orlando Figes, \"a majority of deserters (most registered as \"weak-willed\") were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front\". Even those registered as \"malicious\" deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate\". Forges also noted that the Red Army instituted amnesty weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged  the voluntary return of 98,000-132,000 deserters to the army.[127]\\n\\n1919[edit]\\nVladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev motivate the troops to fight in the Soviet-Polish war, 1 May 1920\\nTrotsky addressing soldiers of the Red Army during the Polish-Soviet War\\nThroughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky\\'s leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the VIIIth Party Congress in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first Politburo after the Congress. But he later wrote:[101]It is no wonder that my military work created so many enemies for me. I did not look to the side, I elbowed away those who interfered with military success, or in the haste of the work trod on the toes of the unheeding and was too busy even to apologize. Some people remember such things. The dissatisfied and those whose feelings had been hurt found their way to Stalin or Zinoviev, for these two also nourished hurts.\\nIn mid-1919, the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky\\'s leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000 and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts.[128]\\nAt the 3–4 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange, the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against Vācietis and Trotsky. Trotsky\\'s plan was rejected, and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin[129] to dismiss Trotsky from his post.\\nHowever, some significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, Vācietis was suddenly arrested by the Cheka on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and Tukhachevsky were defeated during the Battle of Warsaw, but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga\\'s friendship and later his support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.[130]\\nBy October 1919, the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin\\'s troops approached Tula and Moscow from the south, and General Nikolay Yudenich\\'s troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued[131] that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent Estonia and Finland from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee.\\n\\n1920[edit]\\nBéla Kun, Alfred Rosmer, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Frunze and Sergey Gusev, Kharkov, Ukraine, 1920\\nWith the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government\\'s emphasis shifted to the economy. Trotsky spent the winter of 1919–20 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. A false rumor of his assassination circulated in Germany and the international press on New Year\\'s Day 1920.[132] Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of War Communism,[133] which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal.\\n\\nMikhail Kalinin and Leon Trotsky greet Red Army troops. Polish–Soviet War.\\nTrotsky on an anti-Soviet Polish poster titled \"Bolshevik freedom\" which depicts him on a pile of skulls and holding a bloody knife, during the Polish–Soviet War of 1920. Small caption in the lower right corner reads: The Bolsheviks promised: We\\'ll give you peace We\\'ll give you freedom We\\'ll give you land Work and bread Despicably they cheated They started a war\\nWith Poland Instead of freedom they brought The fist Instead of land – confiscation Instead of work – misery Instead of bread – famine.\\nIn early 1920, Soviet–Polish tensions eventually led to the Polish–Soviet War. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued[129] that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army\\'s successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant \"The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war.\"[134]\\nPoland defeated the Red Army, and the offensive was turned back during the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.\\n\\nTrade union debate (1920–1921)[edit]\\nTrotsky\\'s position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker\\'s state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for: \"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime. This is the militarisation of the working class.\"[135]\\nTrotsky with Vladimir Lenin and Klim Voroshilov among soldiers in Petrograd in 1921.\\nLenin sharply criticized Trotsky and accused him of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\" and of staging \"factional attacks.\" His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. Bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin\\'s position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky\\'s expense.\\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin\\'s and Trotsky\\'s supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, Yevgeny Preobrazhensky and Leonid Serebryakov) supporting Trotsky.\\nAt a meeting of his faction at the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921, Lenin\\'s faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky\\'s supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky\\'s place in the secretariat was taken by Vyacheslav Molotov. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents.\\n\\nRed Army troops attack Kronstadt sailors in March 1921.\\nDisappointed in the direction of the Bolshevik government, the rebels from Kronstadt—whom Leon Trotsky himself had praised earlier as \"adornment and pride of the revolution\"—demanded a series of reforms: reduction in Bolshevik power, newly elected soviet councils to include socialist and anarchist groups, economic freedom for peasants and workers, dissolution of the bureaucratic governmental organs created during the civil war, and the restoration of civil rights for the working class.[136]\\nConvinced of the popularity of the reforms they were fighting for (which they partially tried to implement during the revolt), the Kronstadt seamen waited in vain for the support of the population in the rest of the country and rejected aid from emigrants. Although the council of officers advocated a more offensive strategy, the rebels maintained a passive attitude as they waited for the government to take the first step in negotiations. By contrast, the authorities took an uncompromising stance, presenting an ultimatum demanding unconditional surrender on March 5. Once this period expired, the Bolsheviks raided the island several times and suppressed the revolt on March 18 after killing several thousand people.\\nAt the end of the Tenth Congress, Trotsky himself gave the order for the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, which was the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.[137] Trotsky presented alleged French press articles announcing the revolt two weeks before its outbreak as proof that the rebellion was a plan devised by the emigre and the forces of the Entente. Lenin used the same tactic to accuse the rebels a few days later at the 10th Party Congress.[138] Trotsky\\'s role was questioned by other socialists, including ex-Trotskyists. In the United States, Dwight Macdonald broke with Trotsky and left the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party by noting the Kronstadt rebellion.[139] A similar critique of Trotsky\\'s role in the Kronstadt rebellion was raised by American anarchist Emma Goldman. In her essay \"Trotsky Protests Too Much\", she states, \"I admit, the dictatorship under Stalin\\'s rule has become monstrous. That does not, however, lessen the guilt of Leon Trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which Kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes\".[140][141][142] Some Trotskyists, most notably Abbie Bakan, have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were \"counterrevolutionary\" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors\\' March rebellion.[143] Other historians, most notably Paul Avrich, claimed the evidence did not point towards this conclusion, and saw the Kronstadt Rebellion as spontaneous.[144]\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s contribution to the Russian Revolution[edit]\\nLeon Trotsky, the People\\'s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, as the Guard of the October Revolution on 14 May 1923\\nVladimir Cherniaev, a leading Russian historian, sums up Trotsky\\'s main contributions to the Russian Revolution:\\n\\nTrotsky bears a great deal of responsibility both for the victory of the Red Army in the civil war, and for the establishment of a one-party authoritarian state with its apparatus for ruthlessly suppressing dissent... He was an ideologist and practitioner of the Red Terror. He despised \"bourgeois democracy\"; he believed that spinelessness and soft-heartedness would destroy the revolution, and that the suppression of the propertied classes and political opponents would clear the historical arena for socialism. He was the initiator of concentration camps, compulsory \"labour camps\", and the militarization of labour, and the state takeover of trade unions. Trotsky was implicated in many practices which would become standard in the Stalin era, including summary executions.[145]\\nHistorian Geoffrey Swain argues that:\\n\\nThe Bolsheviks triumphed in the Civil War because of Trotsky\\'s ability to work with military specialists, because of the style of work he introduced where widescale consultation was followed through by swift and determined action.[146]\\nLenin said in 1921 that Trotsky was \"in love with organisation,\" but in working politics, \"he has not got a clue.\" Swain explains the paradox by arguing that Trotsky was not good at teamwork; he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist, not as a professional revolutionary like the others.[147]\\n\\nLenin\\'s illness (1922–1923)[edit]\\nTrotsky with Red Army soldiers in Moscow, 1922\\nIn late 1921, Lenin\\'s health deteriorated and he was absent from Moscow for longer periods of time. He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee general secretary.[d] Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev[e] became part of the troika (triumvirate) formed by Stalin to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number-two man in the country and Lenin\\'s heir presumptive, would not succeed Lenin.\\nThe rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the troika. Stalin\\'s power of patronage[f] in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted \\'normality,\\' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the troika nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).[148] In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\". Lenin was shocked and responded:[149]\\n\\nThrowing Trotsky overboard—surely you are hinting at that, it is impossible to interpret it otherwise—is the height of stupidity. If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that????\\nFrom then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in Lenin\\'s Testament. As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the Council of People\\'s Commissars (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky \"categorically refused\". Lenin\\'s proposal has been interpreted by various scholars as evidence that he designated Trotsky as a successor as head of government.[150][151][152][153][154]\\n\\nTrotsky with Rakovsky, c.\\u20091924\\nIn late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy.[155] Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), further centralising state control. The alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade[g] but was hindered by Lenin\\'s progressing illness.\\nIn January 1923, Lenin amended his Testament to suggest that Stalin should be removed as the party\\'s general secretary, while also mildly criticising Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders. The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin\\'s wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called \"Great-Russian nationalistic campaign\" at the XIIth Party Congress.\\nAt the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin\\'s final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue.[156] Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the troika.[h] Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev\\'s backers.[157]\\nThe delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a standing ovation. This upset the troika, already infuriated by Karl Radek\\'s article, \"Leon Trotsky – Organiser of Victory\"[i] published in Pravda on 14 March 1923. Stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin\\'s prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.\\nThe power struggle in the Soviet Union which emerged during Lenin\\'s illness and eventual death would also determine the prospect of world revolution. In particular, the leadership of the German Communist party had requested that Moscow send Trotsky to Germany to direct the 1923 insurrection. However, this proposal was rejected by the Politburo which was controlled by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev who decided to send a commission of lower-ranking Russian Communist party members.[159]\\n\\nLeft opposition (1923–1924)[edit]\\nMain article: Left Opposition\\nTrotsky in a 1922 cubist portrait by Yury Annenkov – a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of Time magazine.\\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"Workers\\' Truth\" and \"Workers\\' Group\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission, attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\\n\\nIn the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization. [...] The bureaucratization of the party apparatus has developed to unheard-of proportions by means of the method of secretarial selection. [...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.[160]\\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent The Declaration of 46 to the Central Committee on 15 October, in which they wrote:\\n\\n[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into \"laymen\", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life. [...] free discussion within the party has virtually disappeared, party public opinion has been stifled. [...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.\\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the troika and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev\\'s Pravda article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the troika tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group\\'s final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution\\'s ideas. The troika used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\"[161] and other sins.\\nTrotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as The New Course in January 1924.[162] The illusion of a \"monolithic Bolshevik leadership\" was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of Pravda. The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16–18 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee\\'s position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the Left Opposition.[163] In 1924, in a series of conferences at Sverdlov University; Stalin cited several times, in a critical way \\'the Permanentists\\', as the followers of Trotsky \\'Permanent revolution\\'.\\n\\nLeon Trotsky with Soviet leaders write the letter of defiance to British Foreign Secretary Marquess Curzon of Kedleston in 1923, in a parody of Ilya Repin\\'s Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks\\nSince the troika controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin\\'s Secretariat and Pravda through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky\\'s position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-troika delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky\\'s position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\"[j] as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\".\\nInternationally, Trotsky\\'s opposition and criticism of the ruling troika received support from several, Central Committee members of foreign communist parties. This included Christian Rakovsky, Chairman of the Ukraine Sovnarkom,  Boris Souvarine of the French Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party which was led by prominent theoreticians such as Maksymilian Horwitz, Maria Koszutska and Adolf Warski.[164]\\n\\nAfter Lenin\\'s death (1924)[edit]\\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by troika partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the troika and its supporters. Trotsky\\'s control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing Mikhail Frunze, who was being groomed to take Trotsky\\'s place.\\nAt the thirteenth Party Congress in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:[165]\\n\\nNone of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party. Clearly, the Party is always right... We can only be right with and by the Party, for history has provided no other way of being in the right. The English have a saying, \"My country, right or wrong\", whether it is in the right or in the wrong, it is my country. We have much better historical justification in saying whether it is right or wrong in certain individual concrete cases, it is my party... And if the Party adopts a decision which one or other of us thinks unjust, he will say, just or unjust, it is my party, and I shall support the consequences of the decision to the end.[166]\\nAndrei Bubnov, Kliment Voroshilov, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Kalinin, and Mikhail Frunze attend the October Revolution parade in Red Square on 7 November 1924\\nIn the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party \"regime\", began to crystallise. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the troika, but it also began formulating a program.\\nEconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician Yevgeni Preobrazhensky came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation.[citation needed] That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the troika at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building \"socialism in one country\". These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin\\'s Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the troika, always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published Lessons of October,[167] an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\\nIn it, he described Zinoviev\\'s and Kamenev\\'s opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the Literary Discussion, with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.\\nTrotsky\\'s alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.\\nTrotsky\\'s harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War.\\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People\\'s Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky\\'s expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\\n\\nA year in the wilderness (1925)[edit]\\nLeon Trotsky and Leonid Serebryakov attend the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union in May 1925\\nFor Trotsky, 1925 was a difficult year. After the bruising Literary Discussion and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts: chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in My Life[77] that he \"was taking a rest from politics\" and \"naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears\".[168] Trotsky would also deliver a tribute to Lenin in his 1925 short book, \"Lenin\".[169][170]\\nSome contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man.[171] Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (maintaining Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.[172]\\nIn one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances of the controversy over Lenin\\'s Testament were described by American Marxist Max Eastman in his book Since Lenin Died (1925). Trotsky denied these statements made by Eastman in an article he wrote.[173]\\n\\nIn the meantime, the troika finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance Grigory Sokolnikov aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the XIV Party Congress in December 1925. With only the Leningrad Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed The New Opposition, were thoroughly defeated, while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.Leon Trotsky addresses a meeting in the House of the Unions in March 1926\\nUnited Opposition (1926–1927)[edit]\\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky\\'s supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the United Opposition.\\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the Chinese Revolution. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the GPU (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\\nSoviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,[174] resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, Puyi, on 12 February 1912.[175] Sun Yat-sen established the Republic of China. In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people\\'s army and a national people\\'s party\"—the Kuomintang. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people\\'s army. With the development of the nationalist army, a Northern Expedition was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese Communist Party to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.[176]\\n\\nKalinin and Stalin bearing the coffin of Felix Dzerzhinsky on 22 July 1926. Trotsky can be seen over Kalinin\\'s left shoulder.\\nTrotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition.[177] Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang Kai-shek\\'s right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927 by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.[178][179]\\n\\nDefeat and exile (1927–1928)[edit]\\nTrotsky with his wife Natalia and son Lev in Alma Ata, 1928\\nOn the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Opposition held a street demonstration, and Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party shortly after.[180][181] Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat Adolph Joffe, in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to Alma Ata, Kazakhstan on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to Turkey in February 1929, accompanied by his wife Natalia Sedova and their eldest son, Lev.[182]\\n\\nFate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky\\'s exile (1929–1941)[edit]\\nThe publication of Trotsky\\'s autobiography My Life as reported in the Soviet Union in August 1929, with the editors of Projector titled the publication: \"On the service of bourgeoisie\"\\nAfter Trotsky\\'s expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, \"admitted their mistakes\" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was Christian Rakovsky, who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the Soviet Union and was exiled to Yakutia in March 1933. Answering Trotsky\\'s request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Constantinople.[183] According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky\\'s son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request.[183] Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally \"admitted his mistakes\" (his letter to Pravda, titled There Should Be No Mercy, depicted Trotsky and his supporters as \"agents of the German Gestapo\").[184] Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.[185] However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of Sergey Kirov, and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the Great Purge.[186]\\nAlmost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union\\'s borders were executed in the Great Purges of 1936–1938, although Rakovsky survived until the Medvedev Forest massacre of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin\\'s orders, less than three months into the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Also among the Medvedev Forest victims was Trotsky\\'s sister/Kamenev\\'s first wife, Olga Kameneva.[15]\\n\\nExile (1929–1940)[edit]\\nTurkey[edit]\\nAfter being deported from the Soviet Union, in February 1929, Trotsky arrived in Turkey. During his first two months in Turkey, Trotsky lived with his wife and eldest son at the Soviet Union Consulate in Istanbul and then at a nearby hotel in the city. In April 1929, Trotsky, his wife and son were moved to the island of Büyükada by the Turkish authorities. On Büyükada, they were moved into a house called the Yanaros mansion.[187] During his exile in Turkey, Trotsky was under the surveillance of the Turkish police forces of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Trotsky was also at risk from the many former White Army officers who lived on Prinkipo, officers who had opposed the October Revolution and who had been defeated by Trotsky and the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky\\'s European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety.[188] At this time, he made requests to enter Belgium, France, Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom,[189] but all refused access.\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s house, the Yanaros mansion on the island of Büyükada in Turkey, as it appears today. Trotsky lived at the house from April 1929 until July 1933.\\nIn 1931, Trotsky wrote a letter to a friend entitled \"What is Fascism\" in which he attempted to define fascism and asserted that the Communist International was wrong to describe the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera as \"fascist\" because it was not a mass movement arising from a base in the lower classes.[190]\\nOn 20 February 1932, Trotsky and all of his family lost their Soviet citizenship and were forbidden to enter the Soviet Union.[191][192] In 1932, Trotsky entered via a port into the fascist Kingdom of Italy[193][194] on his way to a socialist conference in Denmark.[195] By the end of 1932, Trotsky had made contact with the anti-Stalin opposition inside the USSR and discussed the possibility of forming a bloc.[196] There was no evidence of any alliance with Nazi Germany or Japan, as the Soviet Union government claimed. The alleged members of the anti-Stalin bloc were Zinovievites, rightists and Trotskyists who \"capitulated\" to Stalin. Kamenev and Zinoviev were also alleged members of the bloc. Trotsky wanted by no means that the alliance became a fusion, and he was afraid of the right gaining much power inside the bloc. Historian Pierre Broué concluded that the bloc dissolved in early 1933, since some of its members like Zinoviev and Kamenev joined Stalin again, and because there were no letters in the Trotsky Harvard archive mentioning the bloc after 1932.[197]\\n\\nFrance[edit]\\nIn July 1933, Trotsky was offered asylum in France by Prime Minister Édouard Daladier. Trotsky accepted the offer, but he was forbidden to live in Paris and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in Royan. The philosopher and activist Simone Weil also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards to stay for a few days at her parents\\' house.[188] Following the 6 February 1934 crisis in France, the French minister of internal affairs, Albert Sarraut, signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France.[188] However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. Accordingly, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of Barbizon under the strict surveillance of the French police, where Trotsky found his contact with the outside world to be even worse than during his exile in Turkey.[188]\\nIn May 1935, soon after the French government had agreed to the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union government, Trotsky was officially told that he was no longer welcome in France. After weighing his options, Trotsky applied to move to Norway.\\n\\nNorway[edit]\\nKonrad Knudsen\\'s House in Veksal, Norderhov, Norway, where Trotsky lived from June 1935 to September 1936\\nAfter obtaining permission from Justice Minister Trygve Lie to enter the country, Trotsky and his wife became a guest of Konrad Knudsen at Norderhov, near Hønefoss, and spent over a year living at Knudsen\\'s house, from 18 June 1935 to 2 September 1936. Trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby Oslo Community Hospital, from 19 September 1935.[198]\\xa0\\nFollowing French media complaints about Trotsky\\'s role in encouraging the mass strikes in France in May and June 1936 with his articles, the Johan Nygaardsvold-led Norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about Trotsky\\'s actions. In the summer of 1936, Trotsky\\'s asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist Nasjonal Samling, led by Vidkun Quisling,[198]\\xa0along with an increase in pressure from the Soviet government on the Norwegian authorities. On 5 August 1936, Knudsen\\'s house was burgled by fascists from the Nasjonal Samling while Trotsky and his wife were out on a seashore trip with Knudsen and his wife. The burglars targeted Trotsky\\'s works and archives for vandalism. The raid was largely thwarted by Knudsen\\'s daughter, Hjørdis, although the burglars did take a few papers from the nearest table as they left.[199] Although the perpetrators were caught and put on trial, the \"evidence\" obtained in the burglary was used by the government to make claims against Trotsky.[198]\\xa0\\nOn 14 August 1936, the Soviet Press Agency TASS announced the discovery of a \"Trotskyist–Zinovievist\" plot and the imminent start of the Moscow trials of the accused. Trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into Moscow\\'s accusations. The accused were sentenced to death, including Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, and executed on 25 August 1936. On 26 August 1936, eight policemen arrived at Knudsen\\'s house demanding that Trotsky sign new conditions for residing in Norway. These conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters, to give no interviews, and to have all his correspondence (incoming and outgoing) inspected by the police. Trotsky categorically refused the conditions, and Trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence.[199] The following day Trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities, with the police officially citing Trotsky as a \"witness\" to the fascist raid of 5 August 1936.[200]\\nOn 2 September 1936, four weeks after the break-in at Knudsen\\'s house, Trygve Lie ordered that Trotsky and his wife be transferred to a farm in Hurum,[201] where they were under house arrest.[198]\\xa0The treatment of Trotsky and his wife at Hurum was harsh, as they were forced to stay indoors for 22 hours per day under the constant guard of thirteen policemen, with only one hour permitted twice a day for a walk on the farm.[198]\\xa0Trotsky was prevented from posting any letters and prevented from arguing back against his critics in Norway and beyond. Only Trotsky\\'s lawyers and the Norwegian Labour Party Parliamentary leader, Olav Scheflo, were permitted to visit.[198]\\xa0From October 1936, even the outdoor walks were prohibited for Trotsky and his wife.[198]\\xa0Trotsky did eventually manage to smuggle out one letter on 18 December 1936, titled The Moscow \"Confessions\".[202] On 19 December 1936, Trotsky and his wife were deported from Norway after being put on the Norwegian oil tanker Ruth, under guard by Jonas Lie. When later living in Mexico, Trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at Hurum, and accused the Norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the Moscow Trials and other show trials, saying:\\n\\nWhen I look back today on this period of internment, I must say that never, anywhere, in the course of my entire life—and I have lived through many things—was I persecuted with as much miserable cynicism as I was by the Norwegian \"Socialist\" government. For four months, these ministers, dripping with democratic hypocrisy, gripped me in a stranglehold to prevent me from protesting the greatest crime history may ever know.[198]\\xa0\\nMexico[edit]\\nTrotsky\\'s house in Mexico City from April 1939 until his assassination in August 1940\\nTrotsky arrives in Mexico, January 1937 with his wife.

He argued that the Soviet state had become a \"degenerated workers\\' state\" controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy, which would eventually either be overthrown via a political revolution establishing a workers\\' democracy, or degenerate into a capitalist class.[207]\\nWhile in Mexico, Trotsky also worked closely with James Cannon, Joseph Hansen, and Farrell Dobbs of the Socialist Workers Party of the United States, and other supporters.[208] Cannon, a long-time leading member of the American communist movement, had supported Trotsky in the struggle against Stalinism since he had first read Trotsky\\'s criticisms of the Soviet Union in 1928. Trotsky\\'s critique of the Stalinist regime, though banned, was distributed to leaders of the Comintern. Among his other supporters was Chen Duxiu, founder of the Chinese Communist Party.[209]\\nWhile in Mexico, Trotsky worked with André Breton and Diego Rivera to write the Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art, which inspired the creation of the organization, the International Federation of Independent Revolutionary Art (FIARI) in 1938. This organization was short-lived and ended before 1940.\\n\\nMoscow show trials[edit]\\nIn August 1936, the first Moscow show trial of the so-called \"Trotskyite–Zinovievite Terrorist Center\" was staged in front of an international audience. During the trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other accused, most of them prominent Old Bolsheviks, confessed to having plotted with Trotsky to kill Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership. The court found every defendant guilty,\\nin absentia, including Trotsky, sentencing them to death. The second show trial of Karl Radek, Grigori Sokolnikov, Yuri Pyatakov, and 14 others, took place in January 1937, during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to Trotsky. The findings were published in the book \"Not Guilty\".[210]\\n\\nThe Moscow trials are perpetuated under the banner of socialism. We will not concede this banner to the masters of falsehood! If our generation happens to be too weak to establish Socialism over the earth, we will hand the spotless banner down to our children. The struggle which is in the offing transcends by far the importance of individuals, factions and parties. It is the struggle for the future of all mankind. It will be severe, it will be lengthy. Whoever seeks physical comfort and spiritual calm let him step aside. In time of reaction it is more convenient to lean on the bureaucracy than on the truth. But all those for whom the word \\'Socialism\\' is not a hollow sound but the content of their moral life—forward! Neither threats nor persecutions nor violations can stop us! Be it even over our bleaching bones the future will triumph! We will blaze the trail for it. It will conquer! Under all the severe blows of fate, I shall be happy as in the best days of my youth; because, my friends, the highest human happiness is not the exploitation of the present but the preparation of the future.\"—\\u200aLeon Trotsky, \\'I Stake My Life\\', opening address to the Dewey Commission, 9 February 1937[211][212]\\nFourth International[edit]\\nPart of a series onTrotskyism\\nConcepts\\nAnti-Stalinism\\nCritique of political economy\\nDeformed workers\\' state\\nDegenerated workers\\' state\\nFrench Turn\\nLeninism\\nPermanent revolution\\nPolitical revolution\\nSocial revolution\\nSubstitutionism\\nTransitional demand\\nUneven and combined development\\nUnited front\\nVanguard party\\nWorld revolution\\n\\nPeople\\nLeon Trotsky\\nTed Grant\\nAlan Woods\\nIvan Smirnov\\nYevgeni Preobrazhensky\\nJames P.

In mid-1933, after the Nazi takeover in Germany and the Comintern\\'s response to it, he changed his mind. He said:[213]\\n\\nAn organization which was not roused by the thunder of fascism and which submits docilely to such outrageous acts of the bureaucracy demonstrates thereby that it is dead and that nothing can ever revive it... In all our subsequent work it is necessary to take as our point of departure the historical collapse of the official Communist International.[214]\\nIn 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International, which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the Stalinist Comintern.\\n\\nThe Dies Committee[edit]\\nTrotsky with American comrades, including Harry DeBoer (left) in Mexico, shortly before his assassination, 1940\\nTowards the end of 1939, Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Representative Martin Dies Jr., chairman of the committee, demanded the suppression of the American Communist Party. Trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the NKVD\\'s activities against him and his followers.\\nHe made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[215]\\n\\nFinal months[edit]\\nAfter quarreling with Diego Rivera, Trotsky moved to his final residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939.[216] On 27 February 1940, Trotsky wrote a document known as \"Trotsky\\'s Testament\", in which he expressed his final thoughts and feelings for posterity. He was suffering from high blood pressure, and feared that he would suffer a cerebral haemorrhage.[217] After forcefully denying Stalin\\'s accusations that he had betrayed the working class, he thanked his friends and above all his wife, Natalia Sedova, for their loyal support:In addition to the happiness of being a fighter for the cause of socialism, fate gave me the happiness of being her husband. During the almost forty years of our life together she remained an inexhaustible source of love, magnanimity, and tenderness. She underwent great sufferings, especially in the last period of our lives. But I find some comfort in the fact that she also knew days of happiness.\\nFor forty-three years of my conscious life I have remained a revolutionist; for forty-two of them I have fought under the banner of Marxism. If I had to begin all over again I would of course try to avoid this or that mistake, but the main course of my life would remain unchanged. I shall die a proletarian revolutionist, a Marxist, a dialectical materialist, and, consequently, an irreconcilable atheist. My faith in the communist future of mankind is not less ardent, indeed it is firmer today, than it was in the days of my youth.Natasha has just come up to the window from the courtyard and opened it wider so that the air may enter more freely into my room. I can see the bright green strip of grass beneath the wall, and the clear blue sky above the wall, and sunlight everywhere. Life is beautiful.

Trotsky27 February 1940Coyoacán.[217]\\nAssassination[edit]\\nThe study where Leon Trotsky was assassinated with an ice axe on 20 August 1940\\nAfter a failed attempt to have Trotsky murdered in March 1939, Stalin assigned the overall organization of implementing the task to the NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov, who, in turn, co-opted Nahum Eitingon. According to Sudoplatov\\'s Special Tasks, the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks to carry out the murder; these three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD\\'s hitherto-established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.[218]\\nOn 24 May 1940, Trotsky survived a raid on his villa by armed assassins led by the NKVD agent Iosif Grigulevich and Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros.[219] Trotsky\\'s 14-year-old grandson, Vsevolod Platonovich \"Esteban\" Volkov (7 March 1926 – 16 June 2023), was shot in the foot. A young assistant and bodyguard of Trotsky, Robert Sheldon Harte, disappeared with the attackers and was later found murdered; it is probable that he was an accomplice who granted them access to the villa.[220] Trotsky\\'s other guards fended off the attackers.[221] Following the failed assassination attempt, Trotsky wrote an article titled \"Stalin Seeks My Death\" on 8 June 1940, in which he stated that another assassination attempt was certain.[222][223]\\nOn 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in his study by Spanish-born NKVD agent Ramón Mercader, who used an ice axe[224] as a weapon.[225][k] The operation was known within the NKVD as \"Operation Utka\" (Operation Duck).\\n\\nA mountaineering ice axe has a narrow end, called the pick, and a flat wide end called the adze. The adze of the axe wounded Trotsky, fracturing his parietal bone and penetrating 7\\xa0cm (2.8\\xa0in) into his brain.[227] The blow to his head was bungled and failed to kill Trotsky instantly. Witnesses stated that Trotsky spat on Mercader and began struggling fiercely with him, which resulted in Mercader\\'s hand being broken. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky\\'s bodyguards burst into the room and nearly beat Mercader to death, but Trotsky stopped them, laboriously stating that the assassin should be made to answer questions.[228] Trotsky was then taken to a hospital and operated on, surviving for more than a day, but dying, at the age of 60, on 21 August 1940 from exsanguination and shock.[229][227] Mercader later testified at his trial:I laid my raincoat on the table in such a way as to be able to remove the ice axe which was in the pocket. I decided not to miss the wonderful opportunity that presented itself. The moment Trotsky began reading the article, he gave me my chance; I took out the ice axe from the raincoat, gripped it in my hand and, with my eyes closed, dealt him a terrible blow on the head.[228]\\nAccording to James Cannon, the Trotskyist secretary of the American Socialist Workers Party, Trotsky\\'s last words were \"I will not survive this attack. Stalin has finally accomplished the task he attempted unsuccessfully before.\"[230] Mercader was tried and convicted of the murder and spent the next 20 years in a Mexican prison. Stalin wrote that the assassin of Trotsky was a dangerous Trotskyist. This is why Mercader had no awards initially, though his mother was presented with the Order of Lenin for her own part of the operation. Ramón Mercader could not be either assassinated or freed from prison by the Soviets. When he was released from jail in 1960 and arrived in the USSR in 1961, Leonid Brezhnev signed a sentence to award Mercader the Order of Lenin, the Gold Star, and the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union \"for the special deed\". The KGB boss Alexander Shelepin presented all these awards to Ramón Mercader in person.[231][232]\\nIn the aftermath of Trotsky\\'s assassination, an estimated 300,000 people had passed by his funeral casket in Mexico City over several days by 27 August 1940.[233][234][235]\\n\\nPersonality and characteristics[edit]\\nPortrait of Leon Trotsky as Commander of the Red Army, 1920\\nTrotsky was regarded as an outstanding orator,[236] preeminent \\ntheoretician[237] and organiser that, in the view of historian Michael Kort, \"forged and directed the Red Army\".[238] He served as one of the original Politburo members in Lenin\\'s government.[239][240] Biographer Isaac Deutscher considered him to be the \"prompter of [the] planned economy and industrialization\" during the early years of the Soviet Union.[241] Historian Laura Engelstein judged Trotsky to be personally fastidious, but possessing the qualities of vanity and volatility which were not shared with Lenin. Engelstein also described him as talented and dynamic, \"but only a second in command\".[242]\\nPolitical theorist Ernest Mandel summarised the dominant image of Trotsky as \"self-confident\",[243] \"unshakeable in the conviction of his historic mission\",[244] \"strict with others and himself\"[245] and \"indifferent to material privileges and to the small joys and sorrows of life\".[245] Mandel argued this image reflected \"certain aspects of Trotsky\\'s personality, strengths and weaknesses\".[245]\\nHistorian Simon Sebag Montefiore described Trotsky as the \"genius of the revolution\"[246] and biographer Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as a \"vivid, complex, multi-faceted personality in the gallery of world figures\" who was remembered \"with hatred and respect, anger and admiration\" decades after his assassination in Mexico.[247] Volkogonov also found Trotsky to be a constant \"spectre\" for Stalin, after his exile, and also wrote that he was \"of a different calibre intellectually, with his grasp of organization and his talents as a speaker and writer\". Volkogonov considered Trotsky \"far superior\" to figures such as Molotov, Kaganovich, Khrushchev, Zhdanov and \"also superior to Stalin and Stalin knew it\".[248]\\nBiographer Robert Service commented that he was a \"volatile and untrustworthy\",[236] \"arrogant individual\"[236] that impressed supporters even during the periods of \"personal adversity in the 1920s and 1930s\"[236] but failed to \"coax and encourage them to the full\".[236] Service stated that Trotsky gave the \"minimum time to the Jewish question\" and believed that \"he ceased to be a Jew in any important sense because Marxism had burned out the fortuitous residues of his origins\".[249]\\nPolitical scientist August Nimtz regarded Trotsky to have had better foresight than Marxist and some non-Marxist intellectual observers with his work \"The Revolution Betrayed\" in 1936. Trotsky argued that the Stalinist regime was a \"ephemeral phenomenon\" and Nimtz believed this had later been proven with the Soviet collapse after 1989.[250] Other scholars have similarly described Trotsky as having a prescient judgement of events such as the rise of Nazi Germany and The Spanish Civil War through his political writings and levels of military accuracy.[251][252] Deutscher also referenced his \"uncanny clear sightedness\" in predicting the emergence of a single dictator who would \"substitute himself\" for the Central Committee, the party and the working class.[253]\\n\\nTrotsky with his second wife in 1932\\nTrotsky was a Marxist intellectual.[254][255][256][257] Russian historian Vladimir Buldakov considered Trotsky, in some respect, a \"typical representative\" of \"Russia\\'s radical intelligentsia\" who had \"elements of bourgeois origin\".[258] He had a diverse and profound range of interests which exceeded that of other Bolshevik theoreticians such as Nikolai Bukharin.[259] He also had a notable interest in literature and wrote on \"everyday life and cultural progress as well as on the more customary Marxism of the day\".[236] Trotsky and his second wife, Natalia Sedova enjoyed Viennese galleries and made frequent visits to museums such as the Louvre and the Tate Gallery across Europe to view specific art collections.[260] He also retained a personal interest in science which stemmed from his youth when he considered studying mathematics and physics at the New Russian University in Odessa.[261]\\nHis personal secretary and later a historian of mathematical logic, Jean van Heijenoort, considered him to be amicable, inquisitive and occasionally charming with new acquaintances during his final years in Mexico.[262] Old Bolshevik Anatoly Lunacharsky viewed Trotsky as the best prepared among the Social-Democratic leaders  during the 1905–07 revolution and stated that he \"emerged from the revolution having acquired an enormous degree of popularity, whereas neither Lenin nor Martov had effectively gained any at all\".[263]\\nHis arch enemy, Stalin, even read and sometimes appreciated a great deal of his writings.[264] According to Rubenstein, Stalin had even acknowledged that \"after Lenin, Trotsky was the most popular figure in the country\" at the end of the Civil War.[154] He also recognized the prominent role of Trotsky during the October revolution in the 1917 Pravda editorial. Stalin himself wrote: \"All practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the president of the Petrograd Soviet\".[265][266][267]\\nUpon his exile in 1929, eighteen of his close relatives remained in the Soviet Union and all were subjected to repressive measures with seven of his family members including his son Sergei Sedov, sister Olga Kameneva and brother Aleksandr Bronstein having been shot.[268] He spoke several European languages \"with a markedly Russian accent\"[269] and identified as a cosmopolitan and internationalist.[270] In the course of his life, Trotsky wrote about 30,000 documents, most of which are contained in various archives.[271] Deutscher stated that Trotsky wrote most of the Soviet\\'s manifestos and resolutions, edited its Izvestia newspaper and also composed the oath of loyalty for the Red Army.[272] According to Mandel, Trotsky wrote the Zimmerwald Manifesto for the Zimmerwald Conference because he was radically opposed to World War I and drafted the Appeal for the Convocation of the First Comintern Congress due to his active involvement with the Third International.[273] He also served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International for the initial Congress sessions.[274][275][273]\\nAside from his interest in political activism, Trotsky also worked as a statistician and a journalist.[276] Trotsky stated that he worked for three newspapers and oversaw the \"Russian Gazette\" with Alexander Parvus. He claimed that the circulation under his tenure had increased from 30,000 to 500,000.[277] However, historians Anthony Heywood and Jonathan Smele believe this was an exaggerated claim and cited circulation figures from the editors of Trotsky\\'s collected works that the figures had in fact increased to 100,000 which they still regarded as impressive and comparatively ahead of Lenin\\'s New Life newspaper by 20,000.[278]\\n\\nPolitical stature and conflicts with Stalin[edit]\\n\\n\\nHad Trotsky won the struggle to succeed Lenin, the character of the Soviet regime would almost certainly have been substantially different, particularly in foreign policy, cultural policy, and the extent of terroristic repression. Trotsky\\'s failure, however, seems to have been almost inevitable, considering his own qualities and the conditions of authoritarian rule by the Communist Party organization.\\n\\n\\n—Historian Robert Vincent Daniels, 1993[279]\\n\\n\\nHistorian Robert Vincent Daniels expressed the view that Trotsky was \"undoubtedly the most brilliant intellect brought to prominence by the Russian Revolution, outdistancing Lenin and other theoreticians both in the range of his interests and in the imaginativeness of his perceptions\". Yet, he emphasised his personal arrogance as an underlying weakness which antagonised other members of the communist movement. Daniels also argued that had Trotsky assumed the role of Lenin\\'s successor then he would have presided over an alternate Soviet Union markedly distinct from Stalin\\'s regime.[279][280]\\nContrarily, Service asserted that the succession of Trotsky would have resulted in a similar totalitarian dictatorship akin to Stalin\\'s rule and increased the likelihood of conflict across the European continent.[281] Although, historian Sheila Fitzpatrick found it implausible that Trotsky like Stalin would have launched an anti-semitic campaign after World War II or initiated the Great Purge. Rather, she suggested Trotsky would presumably have provided good leadership during the Second World War but may have struggled to maintain party cohesion as seen during the succession struggle after 1924.[282] Political theorist David North argued that Trotsky\\'s military policies would have averted the dismantlement of Soviet defenses alongside the high levels of human casualties associated with Operation Barbarossa and the Second World War.[283] Biographer Geoffrey Swain believed that the Soviet Union under the leadership of Trotsky would have been far more technocratic due to his reliance on \"bourgeois experts\" in the planning process.[284] Other scholars have pointed to the fact that Trotsky opposed the policy of forced collectivisation under Stalin and favoured a voluntary, gradual approach towards agricultural production as an area of differentiation.[285][286]\\n\\nTrotsky as People\\'s Commissar for Foreign Affairs with the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, 1917\\nHis enmity with Stalin developed during the Civil War  with the latter\\'s disregard of military specialists whom Trotsky considered indispensable for the success of the Red Army. In  Tsaritsyn, Stalin ordered the imprisonment of several specialists on a barge in the Volga river and oversaw the sinking of the floating prison in which the officers perished.[287][288][289][290] Bazhanov also claimed that Stalin\\'s antagonism towards Trotsky stemmed from the fact that he was Jewish and that the former would refuse to obey military orders during the Russian Civil War.[291] According to Rogovin, Trotsky received hundreds of letters  reporting the use of anti-semitic methods during the inter-party struggle between Stalin and the United Opposition.[292]\\nTrotsky lacked the political acumen to succeed against Stalin\\'s machinations.[293][151][294] Lenin had encouraged Trotsky, in his absence, to challenge Stalin at the Twelfth Party Congress over the Georgian Affair but the latter relented.[295] Historian Peter Kenez believed that Trotsky could probably have removed Stalin with the use of Lenin\\'s testament but he \"stupidly\" acquiesced to the collective decision not to publish the document.[296] Historian Martin McCauley commented that Trotsky \"displayed a lamentable lack of political judgement\" on multiple occasions such as declining Lenin\\'s proposal to become deputy chairman of Sovnarkom, failing to build a power base before forming a bloc with Lenin against the Orgburo and not immediately recognising that a triumvirate had been established to prevent his succession.[293] Rubenstein differed in his interpretation and attributed Trotsky\\'s decision to decline Lenin\\'s proposal because he believed the position had \"little authority of its own\" and overlapped with other government and party officials.[154] Deutscher believed he had underestimated Stalin\\'s cunning, ruthlessness and tenacity on several occasions.[297] Political scientist Richard B.Day argued that it was more probable that Trotsky\\'s interest in building socialism outweighted his desire for personal power.[298]\\nHistorian Orlando Figes noted that Trotsky never held a party post and rarely attended party meetings despite serving as a member of the Politburo. Figes also described him as having \"too many characteristics that made it extraordinarily hard to work collectively with him\". [299] Biographer Joshua Rubenstein regarded Trotsky\\'s position among the Soviet elites as largely dependent on Lenin. Rubenstein also added that he had an image of an outsider within party circles as he had previously been an \"outspoken critic of Lenin\".[300]  Conversely, Volkongov stated that Trotsky had the support of many party intellectuals but this was overshadowed by the huge apparatus which included the GPU and the party cadres who were at the disposal of Stalin.[301] Historian Paul Dukes considered it a debatable notion that his personal \"sophistication\" as a political figure led to \"his defeat in the great struggle of 1923 and after\". He also reached the view that Trotsky did not share Stalin\\'s understanding of the party in which \"fewer than 10 percent of its members were fully literate\" and this was in spite of the fact that Stalin \"was a man of narrower outlook in virtually every respect\".[302]\\nTrotsky himself ascribed his political defeat to external, objective conditions rather than the individual qualities of Stalin. He specifically argued that the failed series of international insurrections as seen in Bulgaria in 1923 and China in 1927 had diminished the prospect of world socialism and demoralised the Russian working class which in turn strengthened the growth of an internal, Soviet bureaucracy.[303] Russian historian Vadim Rogovin also remarked that Trotsky, in the 1930s, did not abandon hope for the spread of the revolution. Rogovin argued that Trotsky\\'s prognosis of world events was plausible as a majority of European countries such as Germany, France, and especially Spain, \"went through a period of revolutionary crisis\".[304] Although, Daniels contended that Trotsky would have in reality been no more prepared than other Bolshevik figures to risk war or the loss of trade opportunities despite his support for world revolution.[305]\\n\\nRelations with Lenin[edit]\\nMain article: Leninism\\nLenin delivering a speech to a crowd in Moscow Square, with Trotsky and Kamenev in the background, May 1920.\\nHis relations with Lenin have been a source of intense historical debate.[306] Historian Paul Le Blanc and philosopher Michael Lowy described Lenin and Trotsky as the \"widely leading figures in the Russia\\'s Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 as well as in the final years of the rising world communist movement\". They characterized Lenin and Trotsky as \"fierce adversaries\" during the early years of the Russian socialist movement but described the duo as having reached a convergence and a substantial agreement in 1917 before colliding their efforts to achieve the October Revolution. They also highlighted the mutual appreciation and respect between Lenin and Trotsky with the former seeking to work closely with Trotsky on the Iskra newspaper, prior to their polemical disagreements, and Lenin acknowledging that his theory on permanent revolution \"happened to be right\" after 1917.[307]\\nHowever, Swain viewed the notion that Trotsky was Lenin\\'s natural heir a myth and cited several scholars such as Erik Van Rees, James White and Richard B.Day who Swain claimed had challenged the traditional characterization of their relationship.[308] North specifically rejected this position and argued Swain sought to discredit historical works appreciative of Trotsky. North continued to argue that Swain gave an insufficient consideration of the \"complex historical, political, social and theoretical issues that arise in any serious study of the Lenin-Trotsky relationship\". He also asserted that Swain had distorted and misrepresented the positions of the cited scholars.[309] Le Blanc also disputed Swain\\'s representation of Trotsky and referenced various historians which included E.H. Carr, Isaac Deutscher, Moshe Lewin, Ronald Suny and W. Bruce Lincoln across different generations. According to Le Blanc, these historians on balance had tilted \"toward the view that Lenin\\'s desired \"heir\" was collective responsibility in which Trotsky placed an important role and within which Stalin would be dramatically demoted (if not removed)\".[310] Similarly, historian Roy Medvedev noted the close association of Trotsky and Lenin in the Soviet republic throughout the period of 1921–24. Medvedev mentioned a number of public commendations such as \"greetings in honour of comrades Lenin and Trotsky were announced at many rallies and meetings, and portraits of Lenin and Trotsky hung on the walls of many Soviet and party institutions\".[311]\\n\\nLenin and Trotsky (both photographed in 1920) were viewed as the leading figures in the first Soviet government\\nInitially, Lenin turned down the leading position of Chairman of the Council of People\\'s Commissars when the Bolsheviks formed a new government, after the October Revolution in 1917, and suggested Trotsky for the position. However, Trotsky refused the position and other Bolsheviks insisted that Lenin assume principal responsibility which thereafter resulted in Lenin eventually accepting the role of chairman.[312][313][314] On a separate occasion, Lenin expressed hostility to the early attempts by the triumvirate to remove Trotsky from the leadership. In a 1922 memo written to Kamenev, he chastised the efforts by the Central Committee to \"throw Trotsky overboard\" as the \"height of stupidity. If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that\\xa0?\".[315][316] In his last testament, Lenin urged the wider party circles to not use and hold Trotsky\\'s non-Bolshevik past against him.[317]\\nSoviet writer Maxim Gorky recollected Lenin in the first version of his sketch, V.I. Lenin, dismissing rumours of an alleged political difference between himself and Trotsky with the words: \"There are many lies, and it seems, particularly many lies about me and Trotsky\". Gorky also stated that Lenin made an approving assessment of Trotsky due to his military organisation of the army in a single year.[318] In the view of Lenin\\'s wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin was \"pleased with the definite manner\" of Trotsky\\'s theoretical comprehension of diverging Russian revolutionary movements during their first meeting in 1902. She similarly expressed this view in a personal note after Lenin\\'s death that her husband\\'s attitude towards Trotsky had \"not changed until his death\" since their initial meeting in London.[307] In his final months, Lenin read several of Trotsky\\'s works among a wider collection of books which interested him. Lenin read Problems of Everyday Life in the last month of his life and instructed Krupskaya to read him a passage from another of Trotsky\\'s books that characterised Marxism and Leninism. Lenin also read Trotsky\\'s pamphlet, The New Course, on the day prior to his death.[319] According to Stalin\\'s secretary, Boris Bazhanov, Lenin  \"in general leaned towards a collegial leadership, with Trotsky in the first position\".[320]\\n\\nLenin\\'s succession[edit]\\n\\n\\nComrade Trotsky, on the other hand, as his struggle against the C.C. on the question of the People\\'s Commissariat of Communications has already proved, is distinguished not only by outstanding ability. He is personally perhaps the most capable man in the present C.C., but he has displayed excessive self-assurance and shown excessive preoccupation with the purely administrative side of the work.\\n\\n\\n—Lenin\\'s testament; 1923[321][322][323][324] Most historians consider the document to be an accurate reflection of Lenin\\'s views.[325][326]\\n\\n\\nTrotsky was generally viewed as Lenin\\'s choice as a successor in 1923.[327][328] According to Mccauley, Lenin had revealed that he planned to retire to the Central Committee and made an arrangement for Trotsky to speak on his behalf as his natural successor which in turn triggered the formation of the troika.[329] Forges drew focus to the increasing alignment between Lenin and Trotsky in 1923. He cited  Lenin\\'s testament which was critical of Stalin and the bureaucracy along with their shared position on foreign trade, party reform and the Georgian affair.[330] Yet, historian Richard Pipes dismissed the view that Trotsky was Lenin\\'s successor due to his proposed and joint appointment as deputy chairman with Kamenev in 1922. Pipes attributed this overstated claim to Trotsky\\'s supporters and explained that he had in fact been reprimanded by the party for \"categorically refusing\" the post.[331] Conversely, Medvedev stated that Trotsky \"undoubtedly would have been first among Lenin\\'s deputies\" given his authority in 1922 and noted that Kamenev lacked any personal desire to become Chairman upon Lenin\\'s death.[332] Rogovin interpreted Lenin\\'s proposal to the Politburo that Trotsky be confirmed as the \"First Deputy Chairman of the Council of the Sovnarkom\" as signifying that he was entrusted \"with the highest government post\" and he argued that this was also considerable given Lenin\\'s illness at the time. Rogovin also referenced a previous proposal by Lenin in 1917 to appoint Trotsky with another senior position as People\\'s Commissar of Internal Affairs.[333]\\nSlavic studies scholar Derek Watson presumed that Trotsky would have been the first Vice-Chairman of an additional RSFSR body working alongside with the other deputies.[334]\\nDeutscher argued that had Trotsky assumed the post of deputy, then it would have been difficult for Rykov to have been promoted above him as chairman after Lenin\\'s death in 1924.[335] Polish historian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski also echoed these views and argued that had Trotsky accepted the post of Vice-Chairman then his prestige and power would have been strengthened as a counter-weight to Stalin\\'s growing influence. Dziewanowski expressed the view that Trotsky as Vice-Chairman would have been a natural successor to Lenin as Chairman of the Soviet Union. However, his rejection of the position enabled Stalin to place Rykov as Lenin\\'s successor and serve as a key ally in the Politburo against Trotsky.[336]\\n\\nRussian peasants holding banners of Lenin (left), Marx (centre) and Trotsky (right) in early Soviet Russia.\\nSimilarly, Soviet historian Victor Danilov believed that Lenin\\'s proposed appointment of Trotsky as deputy \"would have made him in effect Lenin\\'s successor\". Danilov also cited Politburo Secretary Bazhanov\\'s notes of a concluding speech delivered by Trotsky in 1923 to the wider party membership. Trotsky explained his decision to decline the proposed position of Lenin\\'s chief deputy due to concerns about his \"Jewish origins\" which could accentuate anti-semitic attitudes towards the Soviet Union.[337][338] Mccauley stated that Trotsky would \"almost certainly\" have become the successor had Lenin succumbed to his first stroke in 1922.[339] Deutscher noted that Zinoviev had been Lenin\\'s closest discipline rather than Trotsky between 1907 and 1917. However, Zinoviev\\'s opposition to the October revolution had strained his relations with Lenin.[340]\\nOpponents such as Winston Churchill even argued that \"Lenin [had] indeed regarded Trotsky as his political heir\" and sought to protect him before his passing in 1924.[341] Zinoviev and Kamenev also viewed Trotsky as Lenin\\'s most likely successor and sided with Stalin out of fear that Trotsky would remove them from the party leadership.[342] However, his chief  adversary Stalin, strongly denied claims that Trotsky was the succeeding chairman following Lenin\\'s illness. He pointed out that Trotsky was expected to serve as one of several  deputy chairmen under Lenin which included Kamenev, Rykov and Tsiurupa. Although, he did reference a written document signed by Lenin in 1922 which assigned Trotsky and Kamenev different areas of focus as deputy chairmen. Lenin\\'s authorised document proposed Trotsky as deputy chairman of the Council of Commissars rather than Kamenev who was intended to serve only as a deputy chairman of the Labour Defence Council.[8]\\n\\nLegacy[edit]\\nMain articles: Soviet Red Army, Petrograd Soviet, The Fourth International, and Leon Trotsky bibliography\\nLeon Trotsky\\'s grave in Coyoacán, where his ashes are buried\\nIn 1923, the historic town of Gatchina in Petrograd Governorate (now Leningrad Oblast) was renamed Trotsk (Russian: Троцк) by the Soviet authorities after Lev Trotsky.[343] After Joseph Stalin became General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (b), Trotsky was gradually exiled, and the town was renamed Krasnogvardeysk (Красногварде́йск, Red Guard City) in 1929. In 1944, to increase the morale of Russian troops, the town\\'s historic name was restored.[344]\\nTrotsky\\'s house in Coyoacán has been preserved in much the same condition as it was on the day he was assassinated there, and is now the Leon Trotsky House Museum in Mexico City, run by a board which included his grandson Esteban Volkov (1926–2023).[345] Trotsky\\'s grave is located on its grounds. The foundation \"International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum\" has been organized to raise funds to improve the museum further.\\nShortly before his assassination, Trotsky agreed to sell the bulk of the papers he still had to Harvard University. After his assassination, his widow, Natalya Sedova collected his remaining papers and shipped them to Harvard, and in the years following, Harvard managed to collect additional papers that had been hidden from both Soviet and Nazi agents in Europe.[346] These papers now occupy 65 feet (20\\xa0m) of shelf space in Harvard\\'s Houghton Library.[347]\\nTrotsky was never rehabilitated during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the de-Stalinization-era rehabilitation of most other Old Bolsheviks killed during the Great Purges. His son, Sergei Sedov, who died in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was Nikolai Bukharin. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky\\'s books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.\\nTrotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the General Prosecutor\\'s Office of the Russian Federation (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center \"Memorial\").[348]\\n\\nWest German students holding a placard of Trotsky in 1968\\nTrinidadian historian CLR James wrote, in the aftermath of Trotsky\\'s death, that he evoked strong feelings of enmity and fear from several political figures. According to James, this included Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill because \"these men knew his stature, the power of what he stood for, and were never lulled by the smallness of his forces\".[349]\\nHistorian Harold Shukman assessed the conflicting perspectives on Trotsky\\'s legacy in the Soviet Union and the Western world. He also commented on the lack of a balanced view. Specifically, he stated:\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s legacy, unlike those of Stalin and Lenin, had long been submerged and obliterated as a topic of debate, and his place in Soviet history books had correspondingly diminished to one of no importance. For Western readers, however, Trotsky has always been one of the most enigmatic and powerful personalities of the Russian revolution, a Mephistophelian figure whose life ended in an appropriately dramatic way.[350]\\nPolitical theorist David North attributed his diminished influence and historical role to the \"virtually unlimited resources of the Soviet regime, and of Stalinist-run parties throughout the world, [which] were devoted to blackguarding Trotsky as an anti-Soviet saboteur, terrorist and fascist agent. Within the Soviet Union, his political co-thinkers, past and present, were ruthlessly exterminated\".[351] North was also critical of the biographical literature on Trotsky\\'s legacy written by some historians such as Ian Thatcher, Geoffrey Swain and Robert Service. He viewed these recent trends in historiography as \"manifestations of the confluence of neo-Stalinist falsification and traditional Anglo-American anti-Communism\".[352]\\nIn 2018, John Kelly wrote that \"almost 80 years after Leon Trotsky founded the Fourth International, there are now Trotskyite organisations in 57 countries, including most of Western Europe and Latin America\". However, he also argued that no Trotskyite group had ever led a revolution or built an enduring mass political party.[353]\\nRobert Alexander made a similar observation in 1991 that Trotskyists had never assumed power in any nation but explained that the international movement did \"not enjoy the support of a well-established regime, as did the heirs of Stalinism\". Alexander also recognised that the \"persistence of the movement in a wide variety of countries\" and the instability of political events across most of the world means the \"possibility that a Trotskyist party might come to power in the foreseeable future cannot be totally ruled out\".[354]\\nOn the other hand, British historian and socialist Christian Høgsbjerg believed that academic literature on Trotskyism had minimised its historical role in building wider social movements. Høgsbjerg stressed the key role of British Trotskyists in various movements such as the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign (1966-71), the Anti-Nazi League (1977-81), the Anti Poll Tax Federation (1989-91) and the Stop the War Coalition (2001).[355]\\n\\nHistorical reputation[edit]\\nTrotsky in his office, 1922\\nIn modern historiography, Trotsky\\'s legacy has evoked a range of conflicting and diverse views.[356] Biographer Paul Le Blanc stated \"for millions of people throughout the world, Trotsky was initially seen as a revolutionary liberator\".[357] He was viewed by contemporaries in the initial Soviet period and later historians as the hero of the revolution.[358] Historian Betrand Patenaunde also noted his social appeal among the Petrograd workers in which he drew \"vast crowds of workers, soldiers and sailors in Petrograd with his spellbinding oratory in 1917\".[359]\\nIn the Soviet Union, his reputation gradually deteriorated over the course of the succession struggle as his views were presented as sectarian and anti-Leninist.[360] Throughout the Stalin era, his name and image would be erased from history books, museums and films. At the same time, Trotsky became a convenient bogeyman for Soviet affairs and was associated with ideological heresy.[361] The works of Trotsky also remained banned until the Gorbachev era.[362] Following the de-Stalinization period, later generations of Soviet and Russian historians would reevaluate his role in the history of the revolution with varying interpretations.[363]\\nScholarly consensus holds Trotsky to have demonstrated remarkable leadership of the Red Army during the Civil War.[364] He had been awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his role in the Red Army such as organising the defence of Petrograd when other members of the Bolshevik leadership were prepared to abandon the former capital.[365] According to military scholar William C. Martel, scholars view Trotsky as \"one of the outstanding figures in modern military history\" and a \"directing genius\". Martell also regarded Trotsky alongside Marx, Engels and Lenin as instrumental in the development of principles which translated grand strategy into a guiding framework for revolutionary movements.[366]\\nA number of scholars and Western socialists have regarded Trotsky as a democratic alternative rather than a forerunner to Stalin with particular emphasis drawn to his activities in the pre-Civil War period and as leader of the Left Opposition.[367][368] Prior to the October Revolution, Trotsky had been part of an old radical democracy which included both Left Mensheviks and Left Bolsheviks.[369] He had also proposed the election of a new Soviet presidium with other socialist parties on the basis of proportional representation in September 1917.[370] Deutscher described Trotsky as the \"Soviet\\'s moving spirit\" in 1905 and highlighted his representation of Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and the rest of the Soviets on major occasions. [371] Rogovin stated that the Left Opposition, led by Trotsky, was a political movement that \"offered a real alternative to Stalinism, and that to crush this movement was the primary function of the Stalinist terror\". He also argued that the establishment of the one-party Soviet socialist system was due to the conditions which were \"imposed on Bolshevism by hostile political forces\".[372]\\nConversely, other figures such as Volkogonov have strongly criticised his defence of the Red Terror and dictatorship of the proletariat.[373] Service argued that his \"ideas and practices laid several foundation stones for the erection of the Stalinist political, economic, social and even cultural edifice\".[374] Cherniaev considered Trotsky to be partly responsible for the establishment of a one-party, authoritarian state and initiating several military practices such as summary executions which later became standard practice during the Stalinist era.[145] Thatcher cited his defence of terror in his work, Terrorism and Communism: A Reply to Karl Kautsky, but also acknowledged that Trotsky was capable of leniency and had personally urged that White army deserters be treated with understanding.[375]\\n\\nBust of Trotsky at the Leon Trotsky House Museum in  Mexico City, Mexico\\nThis view has been disputed by some writers such as French socialist historian Pierre Broue who criticised Western representations of Trotsky\\'s role in the Kronstadt rebellion which he argued had falsely presented Trotsky as the principal figure that led and was responsible for the repression. He also added that military tribunals and executions for desertions were a common feature of every war and not exclusive to the actions of the Red Army under Trotsky. [376] Dukes believed Trotsky had been maligned and caricatured as a historical figure which necessitated a historical reappraisal.[302] Patenaude regarded Service\\'s characterisation of Trotsky as a \"mass murderer and a terrorist\" to be reflective of a wider attempt to discredit Trotsky as a historical figure and noted his work featured several inaccuracies and distortions of the historical record.[377] Daniels argued that many of the distinctive features of Stalin\\'s rule such as his campaigns against \"bourgeois experts\" as seen with \"the Shakhty trials, his contemptuous anti-intellectualism and the dogmatization of Marxism, the purges—run totally counter to Trotsky\\'s thought\".[378]\\nVarious historians have credited Trotsky and the Left Opposition with shifting the Soviet economic orientation from the NEP policy towards a planned economy through their proposals for mass industrialization.[379] Trotsky had delivered a joint report to the April Plenum of the Central Committee in 1926 which proposed a program for national industrialization and the replacement of annual plans with five-year plans. His proposals were rejected by the Central Committee majority which was controlled by the troika and derided by Stalin at the time.[380] The eventual adoption of the five year plans in 1928 would serve as the basis for Soviet modernization.[381]\\nSeveral scholars have regarded his historical writings on the Soviet bureaucracy as having a considerable influence in shaping the receptive, attitudes of later Marxists and many non-Marxists. Trotsky associated bureaucratism with authoritarianism, excessive centralism and conservatism. Political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz argued that Trotsky had done more than any other political figure to \"show the historical and social roots of Stalinism\" as a bureaucratic system.[382] British cybernetician Stafford Beer who worked on a decentralized form of economic planning, Project Cybersyn from 1970 to 1973, was reported to have read and been influenced by Trotsky\\'s critique of the Soviet bureaucracy.[383] Other historians have noted the literary value of his account of historical events and social analysis with works such as 1905 and The History of the Russian Revolution for wider historiography.[384][385]\\n\\nPolitical ideology and contributions to Marxist theory[edit]\\nMain articles: Trotskyism and Soviet democracy\\nTrotsky reading The Militant, a socialist newsweekly, circa 1936\\nTrotsky considered himself to be a \"Bolshevik-Leninist\",[386] arguing for the establishment of a vanguard party. He viewed himself as an advocate of orthodox Marxism.[387] Trotsky also adhered to scientific socialism and viewed this as a conscious expression of historical processes.[388]\\nHis politics differed in some aspects from those of Stalin or Mao Zedong, most importantly in his rejection of the theory of \"socialism in one country\" and his declaring of the need for an international \"permanent revolution\". Numerous Fourth Internationalist groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyists and see themselves as standing in this tradition. However, they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.\\nSupporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky\\'s opposition to Stalinist totalitarianism, advocating political revolution and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.[389] In particular, Trotsky called for the restoration of the right of criticism in areas such as economic matters, the revitalization of trade unions and free elections of the Soviet parties.[390]\\nTrotsky also formulated a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of Italian fascism and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933.[391]\\n\\nEconomic programme[edit]\\nMain articles: Economic planning, Left Opposition, United Opposition (Soviet Union), and The Transitional Program\\nThe Scissor crisis: retail and wholesale prices of agricultural and industrial goods in the Soviet Union July 1922 to November 1923\\nTrotsky was an early proponent of economic planning since 1923 and favored an accelerated pace of industrialization.[392] His position differed from the majority of Soviet leaders at the time who supported the New Economic policy.[392][393] He specified the need for the \"overall guidance in planning i.e. the systematic co-ordination of the fundamental sectors of the state economy in the process of adapting to the present market\" and urged for a national plan[394] alongside currency stabilization.[395] Trotsky also rejected the Stalinist conception of industrialisation which favoured heavy industry. Rather, he proposed the use of foreign trade as an accelerator and to direct investments by means of a system of comparative coefficients.[396]\\n\\nTrotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev pictured in the mid-1920s as members of the United Opposition\\nTrotsky and the Left Opposition developed a number of economic proposals in response to the scissor crisis which had undermined relations between the workers and peasants in 1923–1924. This included a progressive tax on the wealthier sections of populations such as the kulaks and NEPmen alongside an equilibrium of the import-export balance to access accumulated reserves to purchase machinery from abroad to increase the pace of industrialization.[397][398]\\nThe policy was later adopted by members of the United Opposition which also advocated a programme of rapid industrialization during the debates of 1924 and 1927. The United Opposition proposed a progressive tax on wealthier peasants, the encouragement of agricultural cooperatives and the formation of collective farms on a voluntary basis.[399]\\nTrotsky as president of the electrification commission along with members of the Opposition bloc had put forward an electrification plan which involved the construction of the hydroelectric Dnieprostroi dam.[400][401] He had also warned against the danger of market spontaneity and called for a well-thought out strategy of commercial balance. Overall, Trotsky was sharply critical of Bukharin and Stalin\\'s views on the state of the Soviet economy. Russian historian, Vladimir Buldakov found that some historical research had supported the view that Trotsky advocated the most rational decisions for industrial development.[402]\\nHe elaborated on the need of Soviet democracy for the industrialization period when questioned by the Dewey Commission in 1937:\\n\\nThe successes are very important, and I affirmed it every time. They are due to the abolition of private property and to the possibilities inherent in planned economy. But, they – I cannot say exactly – but I will say two or three times less than they could be under a regime of Soviet democracy[403]\\nAccording to Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation.[404] Other scholars have argued that the economic programme of Trotsky differed from the forced policy of collectivisation implemented by Stalin after 1928 due to the levels of brutality associated with its enforcement.[405][406]\\n\\nPermanent Revolution[edit]\\nMain article: Permanent revolution\\nA Diego Rivera mural  (Man, Controller of the Universe) depicts Trotsky with Marx and Engels as a true champion of the workers\\' struggle\\nThe Permanent Revolution concept is the theory that the bourgeois democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers\\' state, and that the creation of a workers\\' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into proletarian tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for a \"Permanent Revolution\" is first found in the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in March 1850, in the aftermath of the 1848 Revolution, in their Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League:\\n\\nIt is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far—not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world—that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be: The Permanent Revolution.\\nTrotsky\\'s conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism Georgy Plekhanov, that in \"backward\" countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with Alexander Parvus in late 1904–1905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky\\'s books 1905 and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"Results and Prospects.\" Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the Third World shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.[407]\\n\\nUnited front[edit]\\nMain article: United front\\nTrotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the united front, a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution. \\nTrotsky was a strong critic of the shifting Comintern policy position under Stalin which directed German Communists to treat social democrats as \"social fascists\". Historian Bertrand Patenaude believed that the Comintern policy following the \"Great Break\" facilitated the rise of Hitler\\'s party.[408] Marxist theorist and economist Hillel Ticktin argued that Trotsky\\'s political strategy and approach to fascism such as the emphasis on an organisational bloc between the German Communist Party and Social-Democratic party during the interwar period would very likely have prevented Hitler from ascending to political power.[409]\\nAfter he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British Socialist Workers Party in International Socialism, his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.[410]\\n\\nUneven and combined development[edit]\\nMain article: Uneven and combined development\\nThe concept of uneven and combined development derived from the political theories of Trotsky.[411] This concept was developed in combination with the related theory of permanent revolution to explain the historical context of Russia. He would later elaborate on this theory to explain the specific laws of uneven development in 1930 and the conditions for a possible revolutionary scenario.[412] According to biographer Ian Thatcher, this theory would be later generalised to \"the entire history of mankind\".[413]\\nPolitical scientists Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan valued his theory as a \"signal contribution\" to the discipline of international relations. They argued his theory presented \"a specific understanding of capitalist development as \\'uneven\\', insofar as it systematically featured geographically divergent \\'advanced\\' and \\'backward\\' regions\" across the world economy.[414]\\n\\nLiterary criticism and socialist culture[edit]\\nCubist, stylized depictions of Trotsky which have been attributed to Yury Annenkov, 1921\\nIn Literature and Revolution, Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution. Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work as the \"first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader\" and a catalyst for later, Marxist cultural and critical theories.[415] Trotsky\\'s writings on literature such as his 1923 survey which advocated tolerance, limited censorship and respect for literary tradition had strong appeal to the New York Intellectuals.[416]\\nTrotsky presented a critique of contemporary literary movements such as Futurism and emphasised a need of cultural autonomy for the development of a socialist culture. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Trotsky recognised \"like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art\".[417] Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as \"temporary and transitional\" which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the pre-conditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints.[418]\\nPolitical scientist Baruch Knei-Paz characterised his view on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner. Knei-Paz also noted key distinctions between Trotsky\\'s approach on cultural matters and Stalin\\'s policy in the 1930s.[418]\\n\\nIn popular culture[edit]\\nThe comedic film, The Trotsky, centers on a protagonist named Leon Bronstein, played by Jay Baruchel, who believes himself to be the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky.[419]\\nThe characters of Snowball and Emmanuel Goldstein in George Orwell\\'s novels, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four respectively, are based on Trotsky.[420][421]\\nTrotsky\\'s final days and death was dramatized in the 1972 film The Assassination of Trotsky, directed by Joseph Losey and starring Richard Burton as Trotsky.[422][423]\\nThe 8-episode biographical drama Trotsky debuted on the Russian Channel One in 2017, Netflix purchased the distribution rights to the series in 2018 and made it available on its platform.[424]\\n1980s UK band The Redskins debut single was entitled \"Lev Bronstein\", released on the CNT record label in 1982.[425]\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nAnti-Stalinist left\\nFourth International\\nForeign relations of the Soviet Union\\nGroup of Democratic Centralism\\nLabor army\\nLeft Opposition\\nLenin\\'s Testament\\nLeon Trotsky bibliography\\nList of Trotskyist internationals\\nList of Trotskyist organizations by country\\nPetrograd Soviet\\nPrimitive socialist accumulation\\nRussian Revolution of 1905\\nScissors Crisis\\nSocialist democracy\\nTrotsky\\'s train, armoured train carriage which was used for logistical travel and oration speeches.\\nUneven and combined development\\nWorld socialism\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nThe Assassination of Trotsky, 1972 film\\nReds, 1981 film about the October Revolution\\nVariations on the Death of Trotsky, 1991 play\\nFrida, 2002 film\\nThe Chosen, 2016 film\\nTrotsky, 2017 TV series\\n\\n\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Trotsky was People\\'s Commissar for Military Affairs from 14 March 1918 and People\\'s Commissar for Naval Affairs from April 1918 before the offices were merged on 12 November 1923.\\n\\n^ Russian: Лев \"Лейба\" Давидович Бронштейн, tr.

He was replaced by Elena Stasova, and in November 1919 by Nikolai Krestinsky.\\n\\nAfter Krestinsky\\'s ouster in March 1921, Vyacheslav Molotov became the senior secretary, but he lacked Krestinsky\\'s authority, since he was not a full Politburo member. Stalin took over the position as senior secretary, which was formalized at the XIth Party Congress in April 1922, with Molotov becoming second secretary.\\n\\n^ It is not clear why Kamenev, a mild-mannered man with few leadership ambitions and who was the brother-in-law of Trotsky, sided with Zinoviev and Stalin against Trotsky in 1922. Trotsky later speculated that it may have been due to Kamenev\\'s love of comfort, which Trotsky found \"repelled me.\" He expressed his feelings to Kamenev in late 1920 or early 1921:Our relations with Kamenev, which were very good in the first period after the insurrection, began to become more distant from that day.\\n\\n^ The Central Committee\\'s Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath, as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones. The change was prompted by the need to allocate manpower quickly during the Civil War as well as by the transformation of the party from a small group of revolutionaries into the country\\'s ruling party, with a corresponding increase in membership. New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.[citation needed]\\n\\nTo prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee.

He was later ruler of the puppet state of Manchukuo under the Empire of Japan from 1934 to 1945. He became emperor at the age of two in 1908, but was forced to abdicate in 1912 as a result of Xinhai Revolution at the age of six. During his first reign, he was known as the Xuantong Emperor, with his era name meaning \"proclamation of unity\".\\nPuyi was briefly restored to the Qing throne by the loyalist general Zhang Xun from 1 July to 12 July 1917. He was first wed to Empress Wanrong in 1922 in an arranged marriage. In 1924, he was expelled from the Forbidden City and found refuge in Tianjin, where he began to court both the warlords fighting for control over parts of the weak Republic of China and the Japanese who had long desired control of China. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1932 resulted in the puppet state of Manchukuo being established by Japan, who chose Puyi to become its chief executive, using the era name \"Datong\".\\nIn 1934, he was declared emperor of Manchukuo with the era name \"Kangde\" and reigned over his new empire until the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945. This third stint as emperor saw him as a puppet of Japan; he signed most edicts the Japanese gave him. During this period, he largely resided in the Salt Tax Palace, where he regularly ordered his servants beaten. His first wife\\'s opium addiction consumed her during these years, and they were generally distant. He took on numerous concubines, as well as male lovers. With the surrender of Japan in 1945, Puyi fled the capital and was eventually captured by the Soviets who had occupied the country; he was extradited to the People\\'s Republic of China in 1950. After his capture, he never saw his first wife again; she died of starvation in a Chinese prison in 1946.\\nPuyi was a defendant at the Tokyo Trials and was later imprisoned and re-educated as a war criminal for 10\\xa0years. After his release in 1959, he wrote his memoirs (with the help of a ghost writer) and became a titular member of the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference and the National People\\'s Congress of the People\\'s Republic of China. His time in prison greatly changed him, and he expressed deep regret for his actions while he was emperor. He died in 1967 and was ultimately buried near the Western Qing tombs in a commercial cemetery.\\n\\n\\nEmperor of China (1908–1912)[edit]\\n1908 portrait\\nChosen by Empress Dowager Cixi,[1] Puyi became emperor at the age of 2\\xa0years and 10\\xa0months in December\\xa01908 after the Guangxu Emperor, Puyi\\'s half-uncle, died childless on 14\\xa0November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor, Puyi\\'s introduction to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13\\xa0November, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his two-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor.[2] The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up.[3] Puyi\\'s parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son.[4] As Puyi wept, screaming that he did not want to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City.[4] Wang Lianshou, Puyi\\'s wet nurse, was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him.[4] Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see Cixi.[5] Puyi later wrote:\\n\\nI still have a dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that I burst out into loud howls at the sight and started to tremble uncontrollably. Cixi told someone to give me some sweets, but I threw them on the floor and yelled \"I want nanny, I want nanny\", to her great displeasure. \"What a naughty child\", she said. \"Take him away to play.\"[5]\\nA 2-year-old Puyi, 1908\\nCixi died on 15\\xa0November, less than two days after the meeting. Puyi\\'s father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent. During Puyi\\'s coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2\\xa0December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father.[5] Puyi was frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music, and started crying. His father could do nothing except quietly comfort him: \"Don\\'t cry, it\\'ll be over soon.\"[6] Puyi wrote in his autobiography:\\n\\nTwo days after I entered the palace, Cixi died and on 2 December the \"Great Enthronement Ceremony\" took place, a ceremony that I ruined with my tears.[7][failed verification – see discussion]\\nPuyi did not see his biological mother, Princess Consort Chun, for the next seven years. He developed a special bond with Wang and credited her as the only person who could control him. She was sent away when he was eight years old. After Puyi married, he would occasionally bring her to the Forbidden City, and later Manchukuo, to visit him. After his special government pardon in 1959, she visited her adopted son and only then did he learn of her personal sacrifices to be his nurse.[8]\\nGrowing up with scarcely any memory of a time when he was not indulged and revered, Puyi quickly became spoiled. The adults in his life, except for Wang, were all strangers, remote, distant, and unable to discipline him.[9] Wherever he went, grown men would kneel down in a ritual kowtow, averting their eyes until he passed. Soon he discovered the absolute power he wielded over the eunuchs, and he frequently had them beaten for small transgressions.[3] As an emperor, Puyi\\'s every whim was catered to while no one ever said no to him, making him into a sadistic boy who loved to have his eunuchs flogged.[10] The Anglo-French journalist Edward Behr wrote about Puyi\\'s power as emperor of China, which allowed him to fire his air-gun at anyone he liked:\\n\\nThe Emperor was Divine. He could not be remonstrated with, or punished. He could only be deferentially advised against ill-treating innocent eunuchs, and if he chose to fire air-gun pellets at them, that was his prerogative.—\\u200aEdward Behr[10]\\nPuyi later said, \"Flogging eunuchs was part of my daily routine. My cruelty and love of wielding power were already too firmly set for persuasion to have any effect on me.\"[9]\\n\\nPuyi in 1908\\nWang was the only person capable of controlling Puyi; once, Puyi decided to \"reward\" a eunuch for a well-done puppet show by having a cake baked for him with iron filings in it, saying, \"I want to see what he looks like when he eats it\".[9] With much difficulty, Wang talked Puyi out of this plan.[9]\\nEvery day, Puyi had to visit five former imperial concubines, called his \"mothers\", to report on his progress. He hated his \"mothers\", not least because they prevented him from seeing his real mother until he was 13.[11] Their leader was the autocratic Empress Dowager Longyu, who successfully conspired to have Puyi\\'s beloved wet nurse Wang expelled from the Forbidden City when he was 8 on the grounds that Puyi was too old to be breast-fed.[12] Puyi especially hated Longyu for that.[12] Puyi later wrote, \"Although I had many mothers, I never knew any motherly love.\"[12] Empress dowager Longyu ruled with paramount authority over the Qing imperial court, and though she was not the de jure \"regent\", she was the de facto ruler of the Qing empire.\\n\\nSilver 1 yuan coin from the third year of Puyi\\'s reign\\nPuyi had a standard Confucian education, being taught the various Chinese classics and nothing else.[13] He later wrote: \"I learnt nothing of mathematics, let alone science, and for a long time I had no idea where Peking was situated\".[13] When Puyi was 13, he met his parents and siblings, all of whom had to kowtow before him as he sat upon the Dragon Throne.[14] By this time, he had forgotten what his mother looked like.[14] Such was the awe in which the emperor was held that his younger brother Pujie never heard his parents refer to Puyi as \"your elder brother\" but only as \"The Emperor\".[14] Pujie told Behr his image of Puyi prior to meeting him was that of \"a venerable old man with a beard. I couldn\\'t believe it when I saw this boy in yellow robes sitting solemnly on the throne\".[14] Although Puyi could see his family, this happened rarely, and always under the stifling rules of imperial etiquette. The consequence was that the relationship of the emperor with his parents was distant and he found himself more attached to his nurse, Miss Wang (who had accompanied him to the Forbidden City). Later, Puyi began to receive visits from his brothers and cousins, who provided a certain air of normality to his unique childhood.[7][failed verification – see discussion]\\n\\nEunuchs and the Household Department[edit]\\nSeparated from his family, Puyi lived his childhood in a regime of virtual seclusion in the Forbidden City, surrounded by guards, eunuchs and other servants who treated him like a god. The emperor\\'s upbringing was a mixture of pampering and mistreatment, as he was required to follow all the rules of rigid Chinese imperial protocol and was unable to behave like a normal child.[15][failed verification – see discussion]\\nThe eunuchs were virtual slaves who did all the work in the Forbidden City, such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining guests, and the bureaucratic work needed to govern a vast empire. They also served as the emperor\\'s advisers.[16] The Forbidden City was full of treasures that the eunuchs constantly stole and sold on the black market.[17] The business of government and of providing for the emperor created further opportunities for corruption, in which virtually all the eunuchs engaged.[17]\\nPuyi never had any privacy and had all his needs attended to at all times, having eunuchs open doors for him, dress him, wash him, and even blow air into his soup to cool it.[18] At his meals, Puyi was always presented with a huge buffet containing every conceivable dish, the vast majority of which he did not eat, and every day he wore new clothing, as Chinese emperors never reused their clothing.[19]\\nAfter his wedding, Puyi began to take control of the palace. He described \"an orgy of looting\" taking place that involved \"everyone from the highest to the lowest\". According to Puyi, by the end of his wedding ceremony, the pearls and jade in the empress\\'s crown had been stolen.[20] Locks were broken, areas ransacked. Puyi\\'s next plan of action was to reform the Household Department. In this period, he brought in more outsiders to replace the traditional aristocratic officers to improve accountability. He appointed Zheng Xiaoxu as minister of Household Department, and Zheng Xiaoxu hired Tong Jixu, a former Air Force officer from the Beiyang Army, as his chief of staff to help with the reforms. But on 27\\xa0June 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness, just at the moment when the emperor had ordered to carry out the inventory of one of the imperial warehouses. Puyi suspected it was arson to cover theft. The emperor overheard conversations among the eunuchs that made him fear for his life. In response, a month after the fire, he evicted the eunuchs from the palace with the support of the Beiyang Army.[21] The reform efforts did not last long before Puyi was forced out of the Forbidden City by Feng Yuxiang.[22]\\n\\nAbdication[edit]\\nSee also: Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor\\nOn 10 October 1911, the army garrison in Wuhan mutinied, sparking a widespread revolt in the Yangtze river valley and beyond, demanding the overthrow of the Qing dynasty that had ruled China since 1644.[23] The strongman general Yuan Shikai was dispatched by the court to crush the revolution, but was unable to, as by 1911 public opinion had turned decisively against the Qing, and many Chinese had no wish to fight for a dynasty that was seen as having lost the mandate of heaven.[23] Puyi\\'s father, Prince Chun, served as a regent until 6 December, when Empress Dowager Longyu took over following the Xinhai Revolution.[24]\\nEmpress Dowager Longyu endorsed the \"Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor\" on 12 February 1912, under a deal brokered by Yuan, now Prime Minister, with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China.[25] Puyi recalled in his autobiography the meeting between Longyu and Yuan:\\n\\nThe Dowager Empress was sitting on a kang [platform] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief as a fat old man [Yuan] knelt before her on a red cushion, tears streaming down his face. I was sitting to the right of the widow and wondering why both adults were crying. There was no one in the room other than the three of us and everything was very quiet; the fat man snorted as he spoke and I couldn\\'t understand what he was saying... This was the time when Yuan directly raised the question of abdication.[26]\\nLife in the Forbidden City (1912–1924)[edit]\\nUnder the \"Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication\", signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic, and continued to believe that he was still emperor for some time.[27] In 1913, when Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi\\'s tutors told him meant that major changes were afoot.[28]\\nPuyi soon learned that the real reasons for the Articles of Favourable Settlement was that President Yuan was planning on restoring the monarchy with himself as the emperor of a new dynasty, and wanted to have Puyi as a sort of custodian of the Forbidden City until he could move in.[29] Puyi first learned of Yuan\\'s plans to become emperor when he brought in army bands to serenade him whenever he had a meal, and he started on a decidedly imperial take on the presidency.[28] Puyi spent hours staring at the Presidential Palace across from the Forbidden City and cursed Yuan whenever he saw him come and go in his car.[28] Puyi loathed Yuan as a \"traitor\" and decided to sabotage his plans to become emperor by hiding the Imperial Seals, only to be told by his tutors that he would just make new ones.[29] In 1915, Yuan proclaimed himself as emperor, and he was planning to marry his daughter to Puyi, but had to abdicate in the face of popular opposition.[30]\\n\\nBrief restoration (1917)[edit]\\nSee also: Manchu Restoration\\nIn 1917, the warlord Zhang Xun restored Puyi to the throne from 1 July to 12 July.[31] Zhang Xun ordered his army to keep their queues to display loyalty to the emperor. However, then-Premier of the Republic of China Duan Qirui ordered a Caudron Type D plane, piloted by Pan Shizhong (潘世忠) with bombardier Du Yuyuan (杜裕源) from Nanyuan airfield, to drop three bombs over the Forbidden City as a show of force against Zhang Xun, causing the death of a eunuch, but otherwise inflicting minor damage.[32][33] This is the first aerial bombardment recorded by a Chinese Air Force, and the restoration failed due to extensive opposition across China.[34]\\n\\nRelationship with Reginald Johnston[edit]\\nOn 3 March 1919, the Scottish scholar and diplomat Reginald Johnston arrived in the Forbidden City to serve as Puyi\\'s tutor.[35] President Xu Shichang believed the monarchy would eventually be restored, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi \"subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English\".[36] Johnston was allowed only five texts in English to give Puyi to read: Alice in Wonderland and translations into English of the \"Four Great Books\" of Confucianism; the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean.[36] But he disregarded the rules, and taught Puyi about world history with a special focus on British history.[37] Besides history, Johnston taught Puyi philosophy and about what he saw as the superiority of monarchies to republics.[37] Puyi remembered that his tutor\\'s piercing blue eyes \"made me feel uneasy ... I found him very intimidating and studied English with him like a good boy, not daring to talk about other things when I got bored ... as I did with my other Chinese tutors\".[35]\\n\\nTitular emperor Puyi in the Forbidden City\\nReginald Johnston, who became Puyi\\'s tutor in 1919\\nAs the only person capable of controlling Puyi, Johnston had much more influence than his title of English tutor would suggest, as the eunuchs began to rely on him to steer Puyi away from his more capricious moods.[35] Under the Scotsman\\'s influence, Puyi started to insist that his eunuchs address him as \"Henry\" and later his wife Wanrong as \"Elizabeth\" as Puyi began to speak \"Chinglish\", a mixture of Mandarin and English that became his preferred mode of speech.[38] Puyi recalled of Johnston: \"I thought everything about him was first-rate. He made me feel that Westerners were the most intelligent and civilised people in the world and that he was the most learned of Westerners\" and that \"Johnston had become the major part of my soul\".[39] In May 1919, Puyi noticed the protests in Beijing generated by the May 4th movement as thousands of Chinese university students protested against the decision by the great powers at the Paris peace conference to award the former German concessions in Shandong together with the former German colony of Qingdao to Japan.[40] For Puyi, the May 4th movement, which he asked Johnston about, was a revelation as it marked the first time in his life that he noticed that people outside the Forbidden City had concerns that were not about him.[40] After his first interview with the emperor, the British academic recorded his impressions in a report addressed to the British authorities; in this document Johnston mentions:\\n\\nHe appears to be physically robust and well developed for his age. He is a very \"human\" boy, with liveliness, intelligence and an enthusiastic sense of humour. Furthermore, he has excellent manners and is totally free from arrogance […] Although the emperor does not seem to have been spoiled yet, from the nonsense and futility that surrounds him, I am afraid there is no hope that he will emerge unscathed from the moral dangers through of the next few years of his life (very critical years necessarily for a boy in his early adolescence), unless he can be removed from the influence of the hordes of eunuchs and other useless officials who are now almost his only companions. I am inclined to think that the best course of action to take in the interest of the boy himself would be to remove him from the harmful atmosphere of the \"Forbidden City\" and send him to the Summer Palace. There it would be possible for him to live a much less artificial and happier life than he can under the present conditions...[41]\\nPuyi in the Zhang Garden with Wanrong and Johnston\\nPuyi could not speak Manchu; he only knew a single word in the language, yili (\"arise\"). Despite studying Manchu for years, he admitted that it was his \"worst\" subject among everything he studied.[42][43][44][45] According to the journalist Syed Mohammad Ali, Puyi spoke Mandarin when interviewed, but Ali believed he could understand English.[46] Johnston also introduced Puyi to the new technology of cinema, and Puyi was so delighted with the movies, especially Harold Lloyd films, that he had a film projector installed in the Forbidden City despite the opposition of the eunuchs.[47] Johnston was also the first to argue that Puyi needed glasses since he had developed myopia, as he was extremely near-sighted, and after much argument with Prince Chun, who thought it was undignified for an emperor, finally prevailed.[48] Johnston, who spoke fluent Mandarin, closely followed the intellectual scene in China, and introduced Puyi to the \"new-style\" Chinese books and magazines, which so inspired Puyi that he wrote several poems that were published anonymously in \"New China\" publications.[49] In 1922, Johnston had his friend, the writer Hu Shih, visit the Forbidden City to teach Puyi about recent developments in Chinese literature.[50] Under Johnston\\'s influence, Puyi embraced the bicycle as a way to exercise, cut his queue and grew a full head of hair, and wanted to study at the University of Oxford, Johnston\\'s alma mater.[51] Johnston also introduced Puyi to the telephone, which Puyi soon became addicted to, phoning people in Beijing at random just to hear their voices on the other end.[52] Johnston also pressured Puyi to cut down on the waste and extravagance in the Forbidden City and encouraged him to be more self-sufficient.[53]\\n\\nMarriage[edit]\\nGobulo Wanrong, Puyi\\'s wife and Empress of China\\nSecondary consort Wenxiu\\nIn March 1922, the Dowager Consorts decided that Puyi should be married, and gave him a selection of photographs of aristocratic teenage girls to choose from.[54] Puyi first chose Erdet Wenxiu as his wife, but was told that she was acceptable only as a concubine, so he would have to choose again.[55] Puyi later claimed that the faces were too small to distinguish between.[56] Puyi then chose Gobulo Wanrong, the daughter of one of Manchuria\\'s richest aristocrats, who had been educated in English by American missionaries in Tianjin, who was considered to be an acceptable empress by the Dowager Consorts.[57] On 15 March 1922, the betrothal of Puyi and Wanrong was announced in the newspapers. On 17 March, Wanrong took the train to Beijing, and on 6 April, Puyi went to the Qing family shrine to inform his ancestors that he would be married to her later that year.[57] Puyi did not meet Wanrong until their wedding.[57]\\nIn an interview in 1986, Prince Pujie told Behr: \"Puyi constantly talked about going to England and becoming an Oxford student, like Johnston.\"[58] On 4\\xa0June 1922, Puyi attempted to escape from the Forbidden City and planned to issue an open letter to \"the people of China\" renouncing the title of Emperor before leaving for Oxford.[59] The escape attempt failed when Johnston vetoed it and refused to call a taxi, and Puyi was too frightened to live on the streets of Beijing on his own.[60] Pujie said of Puyi\\'s escape attempt: \"Puyi\\'s decision had nothing to do with the impending marriage. He felt cooped up, and wanted out.\"[59] Johnston later recounted his time as Puyi\\'s tutor between 1919 and 1924 in his 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City, one of the main sources of information about Puyi\\'s life in this period, though Behr cautioned that Johnston painted an idealised picture of Puyi, avoiding all mention of Puyi\\'s sexuality, merely average academic ability, erratic mood swings, and eunuch-flogging. Pujie told Behr of Puyi\\'s moods: \"When he was in a good mood, everything was fine, and he was a charming companion. If something upset him, his dark side would emerge.\"[61] On 21\\xa0October 1922, Puyi\\'s wedding to Princess Wanrong began with the \"betrothal presents\" of 18\\xa0sheep, 2\\xa0horses, 40\\xa0pieces of satin, and 80\\xa0rolls of cloth, marched from the Forbidden City to Wanrong\\'s house, accompanied by court musicians and cavalry.[62] Following Manchu traditions where weddings were conducted under moonlight for good luck, an enormous procession of palace guardsmen, eunuchs, and musicians carried the Princess Wanrong in a red sedan chair called the Phoenix Chair[63] within the Forbidden City, where Puyi sat upon the Dragon Throne. Later Wanrong kowtowed to him six times in her living quarters to symbolize her submission to her husband as the decree of their marriage was read out.[63]\\nWanrong wore a mask in accordance with Chinese tradition and Puyi, who knew nothing of women, remembered: \"I hardly thought about marriage and family. It was only when the Empress came into my field of vision with a crimson satin cloth embroidered with a dragon and a phoenix over her head that I felt at all curious about what she looked like.\"[64] After the wedding was complete, Puyi, Wanrong, and his secondary consort Wenxiu (whom he married the same night) went to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, where everything was red – the colour of love and sex in China – and where emperors had traditionally consummated their marriages.[64] Puyi, who was sexually inexperienced and timid, fled from the bridal chamber, leaving his wives to sleep in the Dragon Bed by themselves.[65] Of Puyi\\'s failure to consummate his marriage on his wedding night, Behr wrote:\\n\\nIt was perhaps too much to expect an adolescent, permanently surrounded by eunuchs, to show the sexual maturity of a normal seventeen-year-old. Neither the Dowager consorts nor Johnston himself had given him any advice on sexual matters – this sort of thing simply was not done, where emperors were concerned: it would have been an appalling breach of protocol. But the fact remains that a totally inexperienced, over-sheltered adolescent, if normal, could hardly have failed to be aroused by Wan Jung\\'s [Wanrong\\'s] unusual, sensual beauty. The inference is, of course, that Pu Yi was either impotent, extraordinarily immature sexually, or already aware of his homosexual tendencies.[65]\\nWanrong\\'s younger brother Rong Qi remembered how Puyi and Wanrong, both teenagers, loved to race their bicycles through the Forbidden City, forcing eunuchs to get out of the way, and told Behr in an interview: \"There was a lot of laughter, she and Puyi seemed to get on well, they were like kids together.\"[66] In 1986, Behr interviewed one of Puyi\\'s two surviving eunuchs, an 85-year-old who was reluctant to answer the questions asked of him, but finally said of Puyi\\'s relationship with Wanrong: \"The Emperor would come over to the nuptial apartments once every three months and spend the night there ... He left early in the morning on the following day and for the rest of that day he would invariably be in a very filthy temper indeed.\"[67] A eunuch who served in the Forbidden City as Wanrong\\'s personal servant later wrote in his memoir that there was a rumour among the eunuchs that Puyi was gay, noting a strange situation where he was asked by Puyi to stand inside Wanrong\\'s room while Puyi groped her.[68] Another eunuch claimed that Puyi preferred the \"land-way\" of the eunuchs to the \"water-way\" of the Empress,  implying he was gay.[69]\\nPuyi rarely left the Forbidden City, knew nothing of the lives of ordinary Chinese people, and was somewhat misled by Johnston, who told him that the vast majority of the Chinese wanted a Qing restoration.[51] Johnston, a Sinophile scholar and a romantic conservative with an instinctive preference for monarchies, believed that China needed a benevolent autocrat to guide the country forward.[51] He was enough of a traditionalist to respect that all major events in the Forbidden City were determined by the court astrologers.[70] Johnston disparaged the superficially Westernised Chinese republican elite who dressed in top hats, frock coats, and business suits as not authentically Chinese, and praised to Puyi the Confucian scholars with their traditional robes as the ones who were authentically Chinese.[51]\\nAs part of an effort to crack down on corruption by the eunuchs, inspired by Johnston, Puyi ordered an inventory of the Forbidden City\\'s treasures. The Hall of Established Happiness was burned on the night of 26 June 1923, as the eunuchs tried to cover up the extent of their theft.[71] Johnston reported that the next day, he \"found the Emperor and Empress standing on a heap of charred wood, sadly contemplating the spectacle\".[72] The treasures reported lost in the fire included 2,685\\xa0golden statues of Buddha, 1,675\\xa0golden altar ornaments, 435\\xa0porcelain antiques, and 31\\xa0boxes of sable furs, though it is likely that most if not all of these had been sold on the black market before the fire.[73]\\nPuyi finally decided to expel all of the eunuchs from the Forbidden City to end the problem of theft, only agreeing to keep 50 after the Dowager Consorts complained that they could not function without them.[74] Puyi turned the grounds where the Hall of Supreme Harmony had once stood into a tennis court, as he and Wanrong loved to play.[75] Wanrong\\'s brother Rong Qi recalled: \"But after the eunuchs went, many of the palaces inside the Forbidden City were closed down, and the place took on a desolate, abandoned air.\"[75] After the Great Kantō earthquake on 1\\xa0September 1923 destroyed the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama, Puyi donated jade antiques worth some £33,000 to pay for disaster relief, which led a delegation of Japanese diplomats to visit the Forbidden City to express their thanks.[76] In their report about the visit, the diplomats noted that Puyi was highly vain and malleable, and could be used by Japan, which marked the beginning of Japanese interest in Puyi.[77]\\n\\nExpulsion from the Forbidden City (1924)[edit]\\nVideo footage of Wanrong and Puyi, 30 November 1924\\nA photo taken of Puyi\\'s bedroom in the Forbidden City shortly after being expelled\\nOn 23 October 1924, a coup led by the warlord Feng Yuxiang took control of Beijing. Feng, the latest of the warlords to take Beijing, was seeking legitimacy and decided that abolishing the unpopular Articles of Favourable Settlement was an easy way to win the crowd\\'s approval.[78] Feng unilaterally revised the \"Articles of Favourable Treatment\" on 5 November 1924, abolishing Puyi\\'s imperial title and privileges and reducing him to a private citizen of the Republic of China. Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City the same day.[79] He was given three hours to leave.[78] He spent a few days at the house of his father Prince Chun, and then temporarily resided in the Japanese embassy in Beijing.[80] Puyi left his father\\'s house together with Johnston and his chief servant Big Li without informing Prince Chun\\'s servants, slipped his followers, and went to the Japanese legation.[81] Puyi had originally wanted to go to the British Legation, but Johnston had insisted that he would be safer with the Japanese.[82] For Johnston, the system where the Japanese people worshipped their emperor as a living god was much closer to his ideal than the British constitutional monarchy, and he constantly steered Puyi in a pro-Japanese direction.[82] However, Johnston tried to get the British diplomatic legation in Beijing to host Puyi, and although the British authorities were not very interested in welcoming the former emperor, the British representative eventually gave Johnston his consent. However, Johnston later discovered that Puyi – in view of the situation and that Johnston was not returning from his efforts – had taken refuge in the Japanese legation after being advised by Zheng Xiaoxu.[83] The Japanese diplomat Kenkichi Yoshizawa gave Puyi the regards of the Japanese government, saying, \"Our government has formally acknowledged Your Majesty\\'s taking refuge in our legation and will provide protection for you.\"</[84]\\nPuyi\\'s adviser Lu Zongyu, who was secretly working for the Japanese, suggested that Puyi move to Tianjin, which he argued was safer than Beijing, though the real reason was that the Japanese felt that Puyi would be easier to control in Tianjin without the embarrassment of having him live in the Japanese Legation, which was straining relations with China.[85] On 23 February 1925, Puyi left Beijing for Tianjin wearing a simple Chinese gown and skullcap as he was afraid of being robbed on the train.[86] Puyi described his train journey to Tianjin, saying, \"At every stop between Beijing and Tianjin several Japanese policeman and special agents in black suits would get on the train so that, by the time we reached Tianjin, my special car was almost half occupied by them.\"[87]\\n\\nResidence in Tianjin (1925–1931)[edit]\\nIn February 1925, Puyi moved to the Japanese concession of Tianjin, first into the Zhang Garden, and in 1929[88] into the former residence of Lu Zongyu known as the Garden of Serenity.[89] A British journalist, Henry Woodhead, called Puyi\\'s court a \"doggy paradise\" as both Puyi and Wanrong were dog lovers who owned several very spoiled dogs while Puyi\\'s courtiers spent an inordinate amount of time feuding with one another.[90] Woodhead stated that the only people who seemed to get along at Puyi\\'s court were Wanrong and Wenxiu, who were \"like sisters\".[91] Tianjin was, after Shanghai, the most cosmopolitan Chinese city, with large British, French, German, Russian and Japanese communities. As an emperor, Puyi was allowed to join several social clubs that normally only admitted whites.[92] During this period, Puyi and his advisers Chen Baochen, Zheng Xiaoxu, and Luo Zhenyu discussed plans to restore Puyi as Emperor. Zheng and Luo favoured enlisting assistance from external parties, while Chen opposed the idea. In June 1925, the warlord Zhang Zuolin visited Tianjin to meet Puyi.[93] \"Old Marshal\" Zhang, an illiterate former bandit, ruled Manchuria, a region equal in size to Germany and France combined, which had a population of 30 million and was the most industrialised region in China. Zhang kowtowed to Puyi at their meeting and promised to restore the House of Qing if Puyi made a large financial donation to his army.[93] Zhang warned Puyi in a \"roundabout way\" not to trust his Japanese friends.[94] Zhang fought in the pay of the Japanese, but by this time his relations with the Kwantung Army were becoming strained. In June 1927, Zhang captured Beijing and Behr observed that if Puyi had had more courage and returned to Beijing, he might have been restored to the Dragon Throne.[94] Puyi was noted to have said in a 1927 article in The Illustrated London News, that \"I never wish to be Emperor again\".[95]\\n\\nPuyi in the Garden of Serenity, as it looked in the late 1920s and early 1930s\\nPuyi\\'s court was prone to factionalism and his advisers were urging him to back different warlords, which gave him a reputation for duplicity as he negotiated with various warlords, which strained his relations with Marshal Zhang.[96] At various times, Puyi met Zhang Zongchang, the \"Dogmeat General\", and the Russian émigré general Grigory Semyonov at his Tianjin house; both of them promised to restore him to the Dragon Throne if he gave them enough money, and both of them kept all the money he gave them for themselves.[97] Puyi remembered Zhang as \"a universally detested monster\" with a face bloated and \"tinged with the livid hue induced by opium smoking\".[98] Semyonov in particular proved himself to be a talented con man, claiming as an ataman to have several Cossack Hosts under his command, to have 300 million roubles in the bank, and to be supported by American, British, and Japanese banks in his plans to restore both the House of Qing in China and the House of Romanov in Russia.[97] Puyi gave Semyonov a loan of 5,000 British pounds, which Semyonov never repaid.[97] Another visitor to the Garden of Serenity was General Kenji Doihara, a Japanese Army officer who was fluent in Mandarin and a man of great charm who manipulated Puyi via flattery, telling him that a great man such as himself should go conquer Manchuria and then, just as his Qing ancestors did in the 17th century, use Manchuria as a base for conquering China.[99]\\n\\nPuyi, pictured with Wanrong\\nIn 1928, during the Northern Expedition to reunify China, troops sacked the Qing tombs outside Beijing after the Kuomintang and its allies took Beijing from Zhang\\'s army who retreated back to Manchuria.[100] The news that the Qing tombs had been plundered and the corpse of the Dowager Empress Cixi had been desecrated greatly offended Puyi, who never forgave the Kuomintang and held Chiang Kai-shek personally responsible; the sacking also showed his powerlessness.[100] During his time in Tianjin, Puyi was besieged with visitors asking him for money, including various members of the vast Qing family, old Manchu bannermen, journalists prepared to write articles calling for a Qing restoration for the right price, and eunuchs who had once lived in the Forbidden City and were now living in poverty.[101] Puyi was often bored with his life, and engaged in maniacal shopping to compensate, recalling that he was addicted to \"buying pianos, watches, clocks, radios, Western clothes, leather shoes, and spectacles\".[102]\\nPuyi\\'s first wife, Wanrong, continued to smoke opium recreationally during this period.[103] Their marriage began to fall apart as they spent more and more time apart, meeting only at mealtimes.[103] Puyi wrote in his memoir:\\n\\nEven if I had had only one wife she would not have found life with me interesting since my preoccupation was my restoration. Frankly, I did not know anything about love. In other marriages husband and wife were equal, but to me wife and consort were both the slaves and tools of their master.\"[104]\\nWanrong complained that her life as an \"empress\" was extremely dull as the rules for an empress forbade her from going out dancing as she wanted, instead forcing her to spend her days in traditional rituals that she found to be meaningless, all the more so as China was a republic and her title of empress was symbolic only.[103] The westernised Wanrong loved to go out dancing, play tennis, wear western clothes and make-up, listen to jazz music, and to socialize with her friends, which the more conservative courtiers all objected to.[103] She resented having to play the traditional role of a Chinese empress, but was unwilling to break with Puyi.[103] Puyi\\'s butler was secretly a Japanese spy, and in a report to his masters, he described Puyi and Wanrong one day spending hours screaming at one another in the gardens with Wanrong repeatedly calling Puyi a \"eunuch\"; whether she meant that as a reference to sexual inadequacy is unclear.[105] Puyi\\'s sister Yunhe noted in her diary in September 1930, that Puyi had told her that \"yesterday the Empress flew into rage saying that she had been bullied by me and she poured out terrible and absurd words\".[106] In 1931, Puyi\\'s concubine Wenxiu declared that she had had enough of him and his court and simply walked out, filing for divorce.[107]\\n\\nCaptive in Manchuria (1931–1932)[edit]\\nIn September\\xa01931, Puyi sent a letter to Jirō Minami, the Japanese Minister of War, expressing his desire to be restored to the throne.[108] On the night of 18\\xa0September 1931, the Mukden Incident began when the Japanese Kwantung Army blew up a section of railroad belonging to the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railroad company and blamed the warlord Marshal Zhang Xueliang.[109] On this pretext the Kwantung Army began a general offensive with the aim of conquering all of Manchuria.[110] Puyi was visited by Kenji Doihara, head of the espionage office of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who proposed establishing Puyi as head of a Manchurian state. The Japanese further bribed a café worker to tell Puyi that a contract was out on his life in an attempt to frighten Puyi into moving.[111]\\nThe Empress Wanrong was firmly against Puyi\\'s plans to go to Manchuria, which she called treason, and for a moment Puyi hesitated, leading Doihara to send for Puyi\\'s cousin, the very pro-Japanese Yoshiko Kawashima (also known as \"Eastern Jewel\", Dongzhen), to visit him to change his mind.[112] Yoshiko, a strong-willed, flamboyant, openly bisexual woman noted for her habit of wearing male clothing and uniforms, had much influence on Puyi.[112] In the Tientsin Incident of November 1931, Puyi and Zheng Xiaoxu travelled to Manchuria to complete plans for the puppet state of Manchukuo. Puyi left his house in Tianjin by hiding in the trunk of a car.[113] The Chinese government ordered his arrest for treason, but was unable to breach the Japanese protection.[80] Puyi boarded a Japanese ship that took him across the Bohai, and when he landed in Port Arthur (modern Lüshun), he was greeted by the man who was to become his minder, General Masahiko Amakasu, who took them to a resort owned by the South Manchurian Railroad company.[114] Amakasu was a fearsome man who told Puyi how in the Amakasu Incident of 1923 he had the feminist Noe Itō, her lover the anarchist Sakae Ōsugi, and a six-year-old boy strangled as they were \"enemies of the Emperor\", and he likewise would kill Puyi if he should prove to be an \"enemy of the Emperor\".[114] Chen Baochen returned to Beijing, where he died in 1935.[115]\\nOnce he arrived in Manchuria, Puyi discovered that he was a prisoner and was not allowed outside the Yamato Hotel, ostensibly to protect him from assassination.[116] Wanrong had stayed in Tianjin, and remained opposed to Puyi\\'s decision to work with the Japanese, requiring her friend Eastern Jewel to visit numerous times to convince her to go to Manchuria.[117] Behr commented that if Wanrong had been a stronger woman, she might have remained in Tianjin and filed for divorce, but ultimately she accepted Eastern Jewel\\'s argument that it was her duty as a wife to follow her husband, and six weeks after the Tientsin incident, she too crossed the East China Sea to Port Arthur with Eastern Jewel to keep her company.[118]\\nIn early 1932, General Seishirō Itagaki informed Puyi that the new state was to be a republic with him as Chief Executive; the capital was to be Changchun; his form of address was to be \"Your Excellency\", not \"Your Imperial Majesty\"; and there were to be no references to Puyi ruling with the \"Mandate of Heaven\", all of which displeased Puyi.[119] The suggestion that Manchukuo was to be based on popular sovereignty with the 34\\xa0million people of Manchuria \"asking\" that Puyi rule over them was completely contrary to Puyi\\'s ideas about his right to rule by the Mandate of Heaven.[119]\\nItagaki suggested to Puyi that in a few years Manchukuo might become a monarchy and that Manchuria was just the beginning, as Japan had ambitions to take all of China; the obvious implication was that Puyi would become the Great Qing Emperor again.[119] When Puyi objected to Itagaki\\'s plans, he was told that he was in no position to negotiate as Itagaki had no interest in his opinions on these issues.[120] Unlike Doihara, who was always very polite and constantly stroked Puyi\\'s ego, Itagaki was brutally rude and brusque, barking out orders as if to a particularly dim-witted common soldier.[120] Itagaki had promised Puyi\\'s chief advisor Zheng Xiaoxu that he would be the Manchukuo prime minister, an offer that appealed to his vanity enough that he persuaded Puyi to accept the Japanese terms, telling him that Manchukuo would soon become a monarchy and history would repeat itself as Puyi would conquer the rest of China from his Manchurian base just as the Qing did in 1644.[120] In Japanese propaganda, Puyi was always celebrated both in traditionalist terms as a Confucian \"Sage King\" out to restore virtue and as a revolutionary who would end the oppression of the common people by a program of wholesale modernization.[121]\\n\\nPuppet rule of Manchukuo (1932–1945)[edit]\\nPuyi as emperor of Manchukuo\\nPuyi accepted the Japanese offer and on 1 March 1932 was installed as the Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan, under the era name Datong. One contemporary commentator, Wen Yuan-ning, quipped that Puyi had now achieved the dubious distinction of having been \"made emperor three times without knowing why and apparently without relishing it.\"[122]\\n\\nPuyi and Wanrong leaving their hotel on 8 March 1932 before travelling to the official Manchukuo founding ceremony in Changchun\\nA New York Times article from 1933 declared: \"There is probably no more democratic or friendlier ruler in the world than Henry Pu-yi, former Emperor of China and now Chief Executive of the new State of Manchukuo.\"[123]\\nPuyi believed Manchukuo was just the beginning, and that within a few years he would again reign as Emperor of China, having the yellow imperial dragon robes used for coronation of Qing emperors brought from Beijing to Changchun.[124] At the time, Japanese propaganda depicted the birth of Manchukuo as a triumph of Pan-Asianism, with the \"five races\" of Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols coming together, which marked nothing less than the birth of a new civilization and a turning point in world history.[125] A press statement issued on 1 March 1932 stated: \"The glorious advent of Manchukuo with the eyes of the world turned on it was an epochal event of far-reaching consequence in world history, marking the birth of a new era in government, racial relations, and other affairs of general interest. Never in the chronicles of the human race was any State born with such high ideals, and never has any State accomplished so much in such a brief space of its existence as Manchukuo\".[125]\\nOn 8 March 1932, Puyi made his ceremonial entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng, who was beaming with joy, Amakasu, whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable.[126]\\nPuyi also noted he was \"too preoccupied with my hopes and hates\" to realize the \"cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me\".[127] Puyi\\'s friend, the British journalist Woodhead wrote, \"outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime\", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorised by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin \"lawless\\xa0... even its main street unsafe after dark\".[128] In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi said he planned to govern Manchukuo \"in the Confucian spirit\" and that he was \"perfectly happy\" with his new position.[129]\\n\\nPuyi and Wanrong travelling to Changchun in March 1932\\nOn 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission arrived in Manchuria to begin its investigation of whether Japan had committed aggression.[125] Puyi was interviewed by Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, and recalled thinking that he desperately wanted to ask him for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that \"the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free\".[130] After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: \"Your Excellency\\'s manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully\".[131] The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the commission as its Chinese assessor, received a secret message saying \"...\\xa0a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me\".[132] The representative, posing as an antique dealer, \"...\\xa0told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported\".[133] Koo said he was \"touched\" but could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the \"final blow\" to her, leading her into a downward spiral.[133] Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called \"bandits\". General Doihara was able in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan, to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defence Minister.[134] Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma\\'s defection turned to be a ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defence Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.[134]\\n\\nPuyi\\'s edict of ascending the throne\\nEmperor Hirohito wanted to see if Puyi was reliable before giving him an imperial title, and it was not until October 1933 that General Doihara told him he was to be an emperor again, causing Puyi to go, in his own words, \"wild with joy\", though he was disappointed that he was not given back his old title of \"Great Qing Emperor\".[135] At the same time, Doihara informed Puyi that \"the Emperor [of Japan] is your father and is represented in Manchukuo as the Kwantung army which must be obeyed like a father\".[136] Right from the start, Manchukuo was infamous for its high crime rate, as Japanese-sponsored gangs of Chinese, Korean, and Russian gangsters fought one another for the control of opium houses, brothels, and gambling dens.[137] There were nine different Japanese or Japanese-sponsored police/intelligence agencies operating in Manchukuo, who were all told by Tokyo that Japan was a poor country and that they were to pay for their own operations by engaging in organised crime.[138] The Italian adventurer Amleto Vespa remembered that General Kenji Doihara told him Manchuria was going to have to pay for its own exploitation.[139] In 1933, Simon Kaspé, a French Jewish pianist visiting his father in Manchukuo, who owned a hotel in Harbin, was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by an anti-Semitic gang from the Russian Fascists. The Kaspé case became an international cause célèbre, attracting much media attention around the world, ultimately leading to two trials in Harbin in 1935 and 1936, as the evidence that the Russian fascist gang who had killed Kaspé was working for the Kenpeitai, the military police of the Imperial Japanese Army, had become too strong for even Tokyo to ignore.[140] Puyi was portrayed as having (with a little help from the Kwantung Army) saved the people from the chaos of rule by the Zhang family.[141] Manchukuo\\'s high crime rate, and the much publicised Kaspé case, made a mockery of the claim that Puyi had saved the people of Manchuria from a lawless and violent regime.[141]\\n\\nAs emperor of Manchukuo[edit]\\nManchukuo Enthronement Commemorative Medal\\nOn 1 March 1934, he was crowned Emperor of Manchukuo, under the reign title Kangde in Changchun. A sign of the true rulers of Manchukuo was the presence of General Masahiko Amakasu during the coronation; ostensibly there as the film director to record the coronation, Amakasu served as Puyi\\'s minder, keeping a careful watch on him to prevent him from going off script.[142] Wanrong was excluded from the coronation: her addiction to opium, anti-Japanese feelings, dislike of Puyi, and growing reputation for being \"difficult\" and unpredictable led Amakasu to the conclusion that she could not be trusted to behave.[143] Though submissive in public to the Japanese, Puyi was constantly at odds with them in private. He resented being \"Head of State\" and then \"Emperor of Manchukuo\" rather than being fully restored as a Qing Emperor. At his enthronement, he clashed with Japan over dress; they wanted him to wear a military uniform like those used by the Manchukuo military, whereas he considered it an insult to wear anything but traditional Manchu robes. In a typical compromise, he wore a Western military uniform to his enthronement[144] (the only Chinese emperor ever to do so) and a dragon robe to the announcement of his accession at the Temple of Heaven.[145] Puyi was driven to his coronation in a Lincoln limousine with bulletproof windows followed by nine Packards, and during his coronation scrolls were read out while sacred wine bottles were opened for the guests to celebrate the beginning of a \"Reign of Tranquillity and Virtue\".[146] The invitations for the coronation were issued by the Kwantung Army and 70% of those who attended Puyi\\'s coronation were Japanese.[143] Time magazine published an article about Puyi\\'s coronation in March 1934.[147]\\nThe Japanese chose as the capital of Manchukuo the industrial city of Changchun, which was renamed Xinjing. Puyi had wanted the capital to be Mukden (modern Shenyang), which had been the Qing capital before the conquest of the Ming in 1644, but was overruled by his Japanese masters.[148] Puyi hated Xinjing, which he regarded as an undistinguished industrial city that lacked the historical connections with the Qing that Mukden had.[148] As there was no palace in Changchun, Puyi moved into what had once been the office of the Salt Tax Administration during the Russian period, and as result, the building was known as Salt Tax Palace, which is now the Museum of the Imperial Palace of Manchukuo.[148] Puyi lived there as a virtual prisoner and could not leave without permission.[149] Shortly after Puyi\\'s coronation, his father arrived at the Xinjing railroad station for a visit,[143] Prince Chun told his son that he was an idiot if he really believed that the Japanese were going to restore him to the Dragon Throne, and warned him that he was just being used.[150] The Japanese embassy issued a note of diplomatic protest at the welcome extended to Prince Chun, stating that the Xinjing railroad station was under the Kwantung Army\\'s control, that only Japanese soldiers were allowed there, and that they would not tolerate the Manchukuo imperial guard being used to welcome visitors at the Xinjing railroad station again.[150]\\n\\nCover of Time with individual photos of Hirohito, Puyi, Joseph Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek.\\nIn this period, Puyi frequently visited the provinces of Manchukuo to open factories and mines, took part in the birthday celebrations for Hirohito at Kwantung Army headquarters and, on the Japanese holiday of Memorial Day, formally paid his respects with Japanese rituals to the souls of the Japanese soldiers killed fighting the \"bandits\" (as the Japanese called all the guerrillas fighting against their rule of Manchuria).[150] Following the example in Japan, schoolchildren in Manchukuo at the beginning of every school day kowtowed first in the direction of Tokyo and then to a portrait of Puyi in the classroom.[150] Puyi found this \"intoxicating\".[150] He visited a coal mine and in his rudimentary Japanese thanked the Japanese foreman for his good work, who burst into tears as he thanked the emperor; Puyi later wrote that \"The treatment I received really went to my head.\"[151]\\nWhenever the Japanese wanted a law passed, the relevant decree was dropped off at Salt Tax Palace for Puyi to sign, which he always did.[152] Puyi signed decrees expropriating vast tracts of farmland to Japanese colonists and a law declaring certain thoughts to be \"thought crimes\", leading Behr to note: \"In theory, as \\'Supreme Commander\\', he thus bore full responsibility for Japanese atrocities committed in his name on anti-Japanese \\'bandits\\' and patriotic Chinese citizens.\"[152] Behr further noted the \"Empire of Manchukuo\", billed as an idealistic state where the \"five races\" of the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols had come together in Pan-Asian brotherhood, was in fact \"one of the most brutally run countries in the world – a textbook example of colonialism, albeit of the Oriental kind\".[153] Manchukuo was a sham, and was a Japanese colony run entirely for Japan\\'s benefit.[154] American historian Carter J. Eckert wrote that the differences in power could be seen in that the Kwantung Army had a \"massive\" headquarters in downtown Xinjing while Puyi had to live in the \"small and shabby\" Salt Tax Palace close to the main railroad station in a part of Xinjing with numerous small factories, warehouses, and slaughterhouses, the chief prison, and the red-light district.[155]\\nBehr commented that Puyi knew from his talks in Tianjin with General Kenji Doihara and General Seishirō Itagaki that he was dealing with \"ruthless men and that this might be the regime to expect\".[156] Puyi later recalled that: \"I had put my head in the tiger\\'s mouth\" by going to Manchuria in 1931.[156]\\n\\nPuyi (right) as Emperor of Manchukuo, with Chū Kudō\\nFrom 1935 to 1945, Kwantung Army senior staff officer Yoshioka Yasunori (吉岡安則)[157] was assigned to Puyi as Attaché to the Imperial Household in Manchukuo. He acted as a spy for the Japanese government, controlling Puyi through fear, intimidation, and direct orders.[158] There were many attempts on Puyi\\'s life during this period, including a 1937 stabbing by a palace servant.[80]\\nIn 1935, Puyi visited Japan.[159] The Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Xinjing, Kenjiro Hayashide, served as Puyi\\'s interpreter during this trip, and later wrote what Behr called a very absurd book, The Epochal Journey to Japan, chronicling this visit, where he managed to present every banal statement made by Puyi as profound wisdom, and claimed that he wrote an average of two poems per day on his trip to Japan, despite being busy with attending all sorts of official functions.[160] Hayashide had also written a booklet promoting the trip in Japan, which claimed that Puyi was a great reader who was \"hardly ever seen without a book in his hand\", a skilled calligrapher, a talented painter, and an excellent horseman and archer, able to shoot arrows while riding, just like his Qing ancestors.[161] Hirohito took this claim that Puyi was a hippophile seriously, and presented him with a gift of a horse for him to review the Imperial Japanese Army with; in fact, Puyi was a hippophobe who adamantly refused to get on the horse, forcing the Japanese to hurriedly bring out a carriage for the two emperors to review the troops.[162]\\nAfter his return to Xinjing, Puyi hired an American public relations executive, George Bronson Rea, to lobby the U.S. government to recognize Manchukuo.[163] In late 1935, Rea published a book, The Case for Manchukuo, in which Rea castigated China under the Kuomintang as hopelessly corrupt, and praised Puyi\\'s wise leadership of Manchukuo, writing Manchukuo was \"...\\xa0the one step that the people of the East have taken towards escape from the misery and misgovernment that have become theirs. Japan\\'s protection is its only chance of happiness\".[164] Rea continued to work for Puyi until the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but he ultimately failed in lobbying Washington to recognize Xinjing. At the second trial relating to the long-running Kaspé case in Harbin in March–June 1936, the Japanese prosecutor argued in favour of the six defendants, calling them \"Russian patriots who raised the flag against a world danger – communism\".[140] Much to everyone\\'s surprise, the Chinese judges convicted and sentenced the six Russian fascists who had tortured and killed Kaspé to death, which led to a storm as the Russian Fascist Party called the six men \"martyrs for Holy Russia\", and presented to Puyi a petition with thousands of signatures asking him to pardon the six men.[140] Puyi refused to pardon the Russian fascists, but the verdict was appealed to the Xinjing Supreme Court, where the Japanese judges quashed the verdict, ordering the six men to be freed, a decision that Puyi accepted without complaint.[165] The handling of the Kaspé case, which attracted much attention in the Western media, did much to tarnish the image of Manchukuo and further weakened Puyi\\'s already weak hand as he sought to have the rest of the world recognize Manchukuo.[140]\\nIn 1936, Ling Sheng, an aristocrat who was serving as governor of one of Manchukuo\\'s provinces and whose son was engaged to marry one of Puyi\\'s younger sisters, was arrested after complaining about \"intolerable\" Japanese interference in his work, which led Puyi to ask Yoshioka if something could be done to help him out.[162] The Kwantung Army\\'s commander General Kenkichi Ueda visited Puyi to tell him the matter was resolved as Ling had already been convicted by a Japanese court-martial of \"plotting rebellion\" and had been executed by beheading, which led Puyi to cancel the marriage between his sister and Ling\\'s son.[166] During these years, Puyi began taking a greater interest in traditional Chinese law and religion[167] (such as Confucianism and Buddhism), but this was disallowed by the Japanese. Gradually his old supporters were eliminated and pro-Japanese ministers put in their place.[168] During this period Puyi\\'s life consisted mostly of signing laws prepared by Japan, reciting prayers, consulting oracles, and making formal visits throughout his state.[80]\\nPuyi was extremely unhappy with his life as a virtual prisoner in the Salt Tax Palace, and his moods became erratic, swinging from hours of passivity staring into space to indulging his sadism by having his servants beaten.[169] Puyi later wrote that his orphaned page boy servants, most of whom had had their parents killed by the Japanese, experienced such \"wretched\" lives in the palace they were the size of 10-year-olds at the age of eighteen.[170] Puyi was obsessed by the fact that the vast majority of Puyi\\'s \"loving subjects\" hated him, and as Behr observed, it was \"the knowledge that he was an object of hatred and derision that drove Puyi to the brink of madness\".[171] Puyi always had a strong cruel streak, and he imposed harsh \"house rules\" on his staff; servants were flogged in the basement for such offences as \"irresponsible conversations\".[172] The phrase \"Take him downstairs\" was much feared by Puyi\\'s servants as he had at least one flogging performed a day, and everyone in the Salt Tax Palace was caned at one point or another except the Empress and Puyi\\'s siblings and their spouses.[171] Puyi\\'s experience of widespread theft during his time in the Forbidden City led him to distrust his servants and he obsessively went over the account books for signs of fraud.[173] To further torment his staff of about 100, Puyi drastically cut back on the food allocated for his staff, who suffered from hunger; Big Li told Behr that Puyi was attempting to make everyone as miserable as he was.[174] Besides tormenting his staff, Puyi\\'s life as Emperor was one of lethargy and passivity, which his ghostwriter Li Wenda called \"a kind of living death\" for him.[175]\\nPuyi became a devoted Buddhist, a mystic and a vegetarian, having statues of the Buddha put up all over the Salt Tax Palace for him to pray to while banning his staff from eating meat.[173] His Buddhism led him to ban his staff from killing insects or mice, but if he found any insects in his food, the cooks were flogged.[173] One day, when out for a stroll in the gardens, Puyi found that a servant had written in chalk on one of the rocks: \"Haven\\'t the Japanese humiliated you enough?\"[176] When Puyi received guests at the Salt Tax Palace, he gave them long lectures on the \"glorious\" history of the Qing as a form of masochism, comparing the great Qing Emperors with himself, a miserable man living as a prisoner in his own palace.[177] Wanrong, who detested her husband, liked to mock him behind his back by performing skits before the servants by putting on dark glasses and imitating Puyi\\'s jerky movements.[178] During his time in Tianjin, Puyi had started wearing dark glasses at all times. During the interwar period, dark glasses were worn by Tianjin\\'s homosexual \"tiny minority\" to signify their orientation. Although Puyi likely knew this, surviving members of his court said that he \"really was subject to eye strain and headaches from the sun\\'s glare\".[178]\\n\\nTan Yuling, Puyi\\'s concubine\\nOn 3 April 1937, Puyi\\'s younger full brother Prince Pujie was proclaimed heir apparent after marrying Lady Hiro Saga, a distant cousin of Hirohito. The Kwantung Army general Shigeru Honjō had politically arranged the marriage. Puyi thereafter would not speak candidly in front of his brother and refused to eat any food Lady Saga provided, believing she was out to poison him.[179] Puyi was forced to sign an agreement that if he himself had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised by the Japanese.[180] Puyi initially thought Lady Saga was a Japanese spy, but came to trust her after the Sinophile Saga discarded her kimono for cheongsams and repeatedly assured him that she came to the Salt Tax Palace because she was Pujie\\'s wife, not as a spy.[181] Behr described Lady Saga as \"intelligent\" and \"level-headed\", and noted the irony of Puyi snubbing the one Japanese who really wanted to be his friend.[181] Later in April\\xa01937, the 16-year-old Manchu aristocrat Tan Yuling moved into the Salt Tax Palace to become Puyi\\'s concubine.[182] Lady Saga tried to improve relations between Puyi and Wanrong by having them eat dinner together, which was the first time they had shared a meal in three years.[181]\\nBased on his interviews with Puyi\\'s family and staff at the Salt Tax Palace, Behr wrote that it appeared Puyi had an \"attraction towards very young girls\" that \"bordered on paedophilia\" and \"that Pu Yi was bisexual, and – by his own admission – something of a sadist in his relationships with women\".[183] Puyi was very fond of having handsome teenage boys serve as his pageboys and Lady Saga noted he was also very fond of sodomizing them.[184] Lady Saga wrote in her 1957 autobiography Memoirs of A Wandering Princess:\\n\\nOf course I had heard rumours concerning such great men in our history, but I never knew such things existed in the living world. Now, however, I learnt that the Emperor had an unnatural love for a pageboy. He was referred to as \"the male concubine\". Could these perverted habits, I wondered, have driven his wife to opium smoking?—\\u200aLady Hiro Saga[185]\\nWhen Behr questioned him about Puyi\\'s sexuality, Prince Pujie said he was \"biologically incapable of reproduction\", a polite way of saying someone is gay in China.[186] When one of Puyi\\'s pageboys fled the Salt Tax Palace to escape his homosexual advances, Puyi ordered that he be given an especially harsh flogging, which caused the boy\\'s death and led Puyi to have the floggers flogged in turn as punishment.[174]\\nIn July\\xa01937, when the Second Sino-Japanese war began, Puyi issued a declaration of support for Japan.[187] In August\\xa01937, Kishi wrote up a decree for Puyi to sign calling for the use of corvée labour to be conscripted both in Manchukuo and in northern China, stating that in these \"times of emergency\" (i.e. war with China), industry needed to grow at all costs, and slavery was necessary to save money.[188] Driscoll wrote that just as African slaves were taken to the New World on the \"Middle Passage\", it would be right to speak of the \"Manchurian Passage\" as vast numbers of Chinese peasants were rounded up to be slaves in Manchukuo\\'s factories and mines.[189] From 1938 until the end of the war, every year about a million Chinese were taken from the Manchukuo countryside and northern China to be slaves in Manchukuo\\'s factories and mines.[190]\\nAll that Puyi knew of the outside world was what General Yoshioka told him in daily briefings.[187] When Behr asked Prince Pujie how the news of the Nanjing massacre in December 1937 affected Puyi, his brother replied: \"We didn\\'t hear about it until much later. At the time, it made no real impact.\"[191] On 4 February 1938, the strongly pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Joachim von Ribbentrop became the German foreign minister, and under his influence German foreign policy swung in an anti-Chinese and pro-Japanese direction.[192] On 20 February 1938, Adolf Hitler announced that Germany was recognizing Manchukuo.[192] In one of his last acts, the outgoing German ambassador to Japan Herbert von Dirksen visited Puyi in the Salt Tax Palace to tell him that a German embassy would be established in Xinjing later that year to join the embassies of Japan, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Italy and Nationalist Spain, the only other countries that had recognised Manchukuo. In 1934, Puyi had been excited when he learned that El Salvador had become the first nation other than Japan to recognize Manchukuo, but by 1938, he did not care much about Germany\\'s recognition of Manchukuo.\\nIn May\\xa01938, Puyi was declared a god by the Religions Law, and a cult of emperor-worship very similar to Japan\\'s began with schoolchildren starting their classes by praying to a portrait of the god-emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia became sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor.[193] Puyi\\'s elevation to a god was due to the Sino-Japanese war, which caused the Japanese state to begin a program of totalitarian mobilization of society for total war in Japan and places ruled by Japan.[193] His Japanese handlers felt that ordinary people in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were more willing to bear the sacrifices for total war because of their devotion to their god-emperor, and it was decided that making Puyi a god-emperor would have the same effect in Manchukuo.[193] After 1938, Puyi was hardly ever allowed to leave the Salt Tax Palace, while the creation of the puppet regime of President Wang Jingwei in November\\xa01938 crushed Puyi\\'s spirits, as it ended his hope of one day being restored as the Great Qing Emperor.[175] Puyi became a hypochondriac, taking all sorts of pills for various imagined ailments and hormones to improve his sex drive and allow him to father a boy, as Puyi was convinced that the Japanese were poisoning his food to make him sterile.[194] He believed the Japanese wanted one of the children Pujie had fathered with Lady Saga to be the next emperor, and it was a great relief to him that their children were both girls (Manchukuo law forbade female succession to the throne).[181]\\nIn 1935, Wanrong engaged in an affair with Puyi\\'s chauffeur Li Tiyu that left her pregnant.[195] To punish her, Wanrong\\'s baby was killed.[196] It is unclear what happened, but there are two accounts of what happened to Wanrong after her baby\\'s murder. One account said that Puyi lied to Wanrong and that her daughter was being raised by a nanny, and she never knew about her daughter\\'s death.[197][198] The other account said that Wanrong had found out or knew about her daughter\\'s infanticide[199][200] and lived in a constant daze of opium consumption thereafter. Puyi had known of what was being planned for Wanrong\\'s baby, and in what Behr called a supreme act of \"cowardice\" on his part, \"did nothing\".[196] Puyi\\'s ghostwriter for Emperor to Citizen, Li Wenda, told Behr that when interviewing Puyi for the book that he could not get Puyi to talk about the killing of Wanrong\\'s child, as he was too ashamed to speak of his own cowardice.[196]\\n\\nEmperor Puyi shakes hands with Emperor Hirohito at Tokyo Station on 26 June 1940\\nIn December\\xa01941, Puyi followed Japan in declaring war on the United States and Great Britain, but as neither nation had recognised Manchukuo, there were no reciprocal declarations of war in return.[201] During the war, Puyi was an example and role model for at least some in Asia who believed in the Japanese pan-Asian propaganda. U Saw, the Prime Minister of Burma, was secretly in communication with the Japanese, declaring that as an Asian his sympathies were completely with Japan against the West.[202] U\\xa0Saw further added that he hoped that when Japan won the war that he would enjoy exactly the same status in Burma that Puyi enjoyed in Manchukuo as part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.[202] During the war, Puyi became estranged from his father, as his half-brother Pu Ren stated in an interview:\\n\\n...\\xa0after 1941 Puyi\\'s father had written him off. He never visited Puyi after 1934. They rarely corresponded. All the news he got was through intermediaries, or occasional reports from Puyi\\'s younger sisters, some of whom were allowed to see him.—\\u200aPu Ren[203]\\nPuyi complained that he had issued so many \"slavish\" pro-Japanese statements during the war that nobody on the Allied side would take him in if he did escape from Manchukuo.[204] In June 1942, Puyi made a rare visit outside the Salt Tax Palace when he conferred with the graduating class at the Manchukuo Military Academy, and awarded the star student Takagi Masao a gold watch for his outstanding performance; despite his Japanese name, the star student was actually Korean and under his original Korean name of Park Chung Hee became the dictator of South Korea in 1961.[205] In August 1942, Puyi\\'s concubine Tan Yuling fell ill and died after being treated by the same Japanese doctors who murdered Wanrong\\'s baby.[196] Puyi testified at the Tokyo war crimes trial of his belief that she was murdered.[196] Puyi kept a lock of Tan\\'s hair and her nail clippings for the rest of his life as he expressed much sadness over her loss.[206] He refused to take a Japanese concubine to replace Tan and, in 1943, took a Chinese concubine, Li Yuqin, the 16-year-old daughter of a waiter.[207] Puyi liked Li, but his main interest continued to be his pageboys, as he later wrote: \"These actions of mine go to show how cruel, mad, violent and unstable I was.\"[207]\\nFor much of World War\\xa0II, Puyi, confined to the Salt Tax Palace, believed that Japan was winning the war, and it was not until 1944 that he started to doubt this after the Japanese press began to report \"heroic sacrifices\" in Burma and on Pacific islands while air raid shelters started to be built in Manchukuo.[208] Puyi\\'s nephew Jui Lon told Behr: \"He desperately wanted America to win the war.\"[149] Big Li said: \"When he thought it was safe, he would sit at the piano and do a one-finger version of the Stars and Stripes.\"[149] In mid-1944, Puyi finally acquired the courage to start occasionally tuning in his radio to Chinese broadcasts and to Chinese-language broadcasts by the Americans, where he was shocked to learn that Japan had suffered so many defeats since 1942.[209]\\nPuyi had to give a speech before a group of Japanese infantrymen who had volunteered to be \"human bullets\", promising to strap explosives on their bodies and to stage suicide attacks to die for the Showa Emperor.[208] Puyi commented as he read out his speech praising the glories of dying for the Emperor: \"Only then did I see the ashen grey of their faces and the tears flowing down their cheeks and hear their sobbing.\"[208] Puyi commented that he felt at that moment utterly \"terrified\" at the death cult fanaticism of bushido which reduced the value of human life down to nothing, as to die for the Emperor was the only thing that mattered.[210]\\n\\nCollapse of Manchukuo[edit]\\nOn 9\\xa0August 1945, the Kwantung Army\\'s commander General Otozō Yamada told Puyi that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan and the Red Army had entered Manchukuo.[210] Yamada was assuring Puyi that the Kwantung Army would easily defeat the Red Army, when the air raid sirens sounded and the Red Air Force began a bombing raid, forcing all to hide in the basement.[211] While Puyi prayed to the Buddha, Yamada fell silent as the bombs fell, destroying Japanese barracks next to the Salt Tax Palace.[211] In the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, 1,577,725\\xa0Soviet and Mongol troops stormed into Manchuria in a combined arms offensive with tanks, artillery, cavalry, aircraft and infantry working closely together that overwhelmed the Kwantung Army, who had not expected a Soviet invasion until 1946 and were short of both tanks and anti-tank guns.[212]\\nPuyi was terrified to hear that the Mongolian People\\'s Army had joined Operation August Storm, as he believed that the Mongols would torture him to death if they captured him.[213] The next day, Yamada told Puyi that the Soviets had already broken through the defence lines in northern Manchukuo, but the Kwantung Army would \"hold the line\" in southern Manchukuo and Puyi must leave at once.[211] The staff of the Salt Tax Palace were thrown into panic as Puyi ordered all of his treasures to be boxed up and shipped out; in the meantime Puyi observed from his window that soldiers of the Manchukuo Imperial Army were taking off their uniforms and deserting.[211] To test the reaction of his Japanese masters, Puyi put on his uniform of Commander-in-Chief of the Manchukuo Army and announced \"We must support the holy war of our Parental Country with all our strength, and must resist the Soviet armies to the end, to the very end\".[211] With that, Yoshioka fled the room, which showed Puyi that the war was lost.[211] At one point, a group of Japanese soldiers arrived at the Salt Tax Palace, and Puyi believed they had come to kill him, but they merely went away after seeing him stand at the top of the staircase.[214] Most of the staff at the Salt Tax Palace had already fled,[215] and Puyi found that his phone calls to the Kwantung Army HQ went unanswered as most of the officers had already left for Korea, his minder Amakasu killed himself by swallowing a cyanide pill, and the people of Changchun booed him when his car, flying imperial standards, took him to the railroad station.[215]\\n\\nThe site of Puyi\\'s abdication in a small mining office complex in Dalizi\\xa0[zh][216]\\nLate on the night of 11\\xa0August 1945, a train carrying Puyi, his court, his ministers and the Qing treasures left Changchun.[217] Puyi saw thousands of panic-stricken Japanese settlers fleeing south in vast columns across the roads of the countryside.[217] At every railroad station, hundreds of Japanese colonists attempted to board his train; Puyi remembered them weeping and begging Japanese gendarmes to let them pass,[217] and at several stations, Japanese soldiers and gendarmes fought one another.[217] General Yamada boarded the train as it meandered south and told Puyi \"the Japanese Army was winning and had destroyed large numbers of tanks and aircraft\", a claim that nobody aboard the train believed.[217] On 15 August 1945, Puyi heard on the radio the address of the Showa Emperor announcing that Japan had surrendered.[218] In his address, the Showa Emperor described the Americans as having used a \"most unusual and cruel bomb\" that had just destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; this was the first time that Puyi heard of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which the Japanese had not seen fit to tell him about until then.[218]\\nThe next day, Puyi abdicated as Emperor of Manchukuo and declared in his last decree that Manchukuo was once again part of China.[218] Puyi\\'s party split up in a panic, with former Manchukuo Premier Zhang Jinghui going back to Changchun.[219] Puyi planned to take a plane to escape from Tonghua, taking with him his brother Pujie, his servant Big Li, Yoshioka, and his doctor while leaving Wanrong, his concubine Li Yuqin, Lady Hiro Saga and Lady Saga\\'s two children behind.[219] The decision to leave behind the women and children was in part made by Yoshioka who thought the women were in no such danger, and vetoed Puyi\\'s attempts to take them on the plane to Japan.[219]\\nPuyi asked for Lady Saga, the most mature and responsible of the three women, to take care of Wanrong, and he gave Lady Saga precious antiques and cash to pay for their way south to Korea.[220] On 16 August, Puyi took a small plane to Mukden, where another larger plane was supposed to arrive to take them to Japan, but instead a Soviet Air Force plane landed.[221] Puyi and his party were all promptly taken prisoner by the Red Army, who initially did not know who Puyi was.[221][222] The opium-addled Wanrong together with Lady Saga and Li were captured by Chinese Communist guerrillas on their way to Korea, after one of Puyi\\'s brothers-in-law informed the Communists who the women were.[223] Wanrong, the former empress, was put on display in a local jail and people came from miles around to watch her.[224] In a delirious state of mind, she demanded more opium, asked for imaginary servants to bring her clothing, food, and a bath, hallucinated that she was back in the Forbidden City or the Salt Tax Palace. The general hatred for Puyi meant that none had any sympathy for Wanrong, who was seen as another Japanese collaborator, and a guard told Lady Saga that \"this one won\\'t last\", making it a waste of time feeding her.[225] In June\\xa01946, Wanrong starved to death in her jail cell.[225] In his 1964 book From Emperor to Citizen, Puyi merely stated that he learned in 1951 that Wanrong \"died a long time ago\" without mentioning how she died.[226]\\n\\nLater life (1945–1967)[edit]\\nSoviet imprisonment and trial[edit]\\nPuyi (right) and a Soviet military officer\\nThe Soviets took Puyi to the Siberian town of Chita. He lived in a sanatorium, then later in Khabarovsk near the Chinese border, where he was treated well and allowed to keep some of his servants.[227] As a prisoner, Puyi spent his days praying and expected the prisoners to treat him as an emperor and slapped the faces of his servants when they displeased him.[228]\\nHe knew about the civil war in China from Chinese-language broadcasts on Radio Moscow, but seemed not to care.[229] The Soviet government refused the Republic of China\\'s repeated requests to extradite Puyi; the Kuomintang government had indicted him on charges of high treason, and the Soviet refusal to extradite him almost certainly saved his life, as Chiang Kai-shek had often spoken of his desire to have Puyi shot.[230] The Kuomintang captured Puyi\\'s cousin Dongzhen and publicly executed her in Beijing in 1948 after she was convicted of high treason.[231] Not wishing to return to China, Puyi wrote to Stalin several times asking for asylum in the Soviet Union, and that he be given one of the former tsarist palaces to live out his days.[232]\\nIn 1946, Puyi testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo,[233] detailing his resentment at how he had been treated by the Japanese. At the Tokyo trial, he had a long exchange with defence counsel Major Ben Bruce Blakeney about whether he had been kidnapped in 1931, in which Puyi perjured himself by saying that the statements in Johnston\\'s 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City about how he had willingly become Emperor of Manchukuo were all lies.[234] When Blakeney mentioned that the introduction to the book described how Puyi had told Johnston that he had willingly gone to Manchuria in 1931, Puyi denied being in contact with Johnston in 1931, and that Johnston made things up for \"commercial advantage\".[235]\\nPuyi had a strong interest in minimizing his own role in history, because any admission of active control would have led to his execution. The Australian judge Sir William Webb, the President of the Tribunal, was often frustrated with Puyi\\'s testimony, and chided him numerous times.[236] Behr described Puyi on the stand as a \"consistent, self-assured liar, prepared to go to any lengths to save his skin\", and as a combative witness more than able to hold his own against the defence lawyers.[237] Since no one at the trial but Blakeney had actually read Twilight in the Forbidden City or the interviews Woodhead had conducted with him in 1932, Puyi had room to distort what had been written about him or said by him.[238] Puyi greatly respected Johnston, who was a surrogate father to him, and felt guilty about portraying him as a dishonest man.[239]\\n\\nPuyi\\'s letters to Joseph Stalin\\nAfter his return to the Soviet Union, Puyi was held at Detention Center No. 45, where his servants continued to make his bed, dress him and do other work for him.[240] Puyi did not speak Russian and had limited contacts with his Soviet guards, using a few Manchukuo prisoners as translators.[241] One prisoner told Puyi that the Soviets would keep him in Siberia forever because \"this is the part of the world you come from\".[241] The Soviets had promised the Chinese Communists that they would hand over the high value prisoners when the CCP won the civil war, and wanted to keep Puyi alive.[242] Puyi\\'s brother-in-law Rong Qi and some of his servants were not considered high value, and were sent to work at a Siberian rehabilitation camp.[243]\\n\\nIn the People\\'s Republic[edit]\\nContinued imprisonment[edit]\\nWhen the Chinese Communist Party ] came to power in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after negotiations between the Soviet Union and China.[244][245] Puyi was of considerable value to Mao, as Behr noted: \"In the eyes of Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders, Pu Yi, the last Emperor, was the epitome of all that had been evil in old Chinese society. If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party\".[246] Puyi was to be subjected to \"remodelling\" to make him into a Communist.[247]\\n\\nFushun War Criminals Prison\\nPuyi testifying during the 1950s\\nIn 1950, the Soviets loaded Puyi and the rest of the Manchukuo and Japanese prisoners onto a train that took them to China with Puyi convinced he would be executed when he arrived.[248] Puyi was surprised at the kindness of his Chinese guards, who told him this was the beginning of a new life for him.[249] In attempt to ingratiate himself, Puyi for the first time in his life addressed commoners with the informal word for \"you\" instead of formal word for \"you\".[249]\\nExcept for a period during the Korean War, when he was moved to Harbin, Puyi spent ten years in the Fushun War Criminals Prison in Liaoning until he was declared reformed. The prisoners at Fushun were senior Japanese, Manchukuo and Kuomintang officials and officers.[250] Puyi was the weakest and most hapless of the prisoners, and was often bullied by the others, who liked to humiliate the emperor; he might not have survived his imprisonment had the warden Jin Yuan not gone out of his way to protect him.[251] Puyi had never brushed his teeth or tied his own shoelaces once in his life and had to do these basic tasks in prison, subjecting him to the ridicule of other prisoners.[252] In 1951, Puyi learned for the first time that Wanrong had died in 1946.[226]\\n\\nPuyi being prisoner in Fushun.\\nMuch of Puyi\\'s \"remodelling\" consisted of attending \"Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought discussion groups\" where the prisoners would discuss their lives before being imprisoned.[253] When Puyi protested to Jin that it had been impossible to resist Japan and there was nothing he could have done, Jin confronted him with people who had fought in the resistance and had been tortured, and asked him why ordinary people in Manchukuo resisted while an emperor did nothing.[254] Puyi had to attend lectures where a former Japanese civil servant spoke about the exploitation of Manchukuo while a former officer in the Kenpeitai talked about how he rounded up people for slave labour and ordered mass executions.[255]\\nAt one point, Puyi was taken to Harbin and Pingfang to see where the infamous Unit 731, the chemical and biological warfare unit in the Japanese Army, had conducted gruesome experiments on people. Puyi noted in shame and horror: \"All the atrocities had been carried out in my name\".[255] Puyi by the mid-1950s was overwhelmed with guilt and often told Jin that he felt utterly worthless to the point that he considered suicide.[254] Jin told Puyi to express his guilt in writing. Puyi later recalled he felt \"that I was up against an irresistible force that would not rest until it found out everything\".[256]\\nSometimes Puyi was taken out for tours of the countryside of Manchuria. On one, he met a farmer\\'s wife whose family had been evicted to make way for Japanese settlers and had almost starved to death while working as a slave in one of Manchukuo\\'s factories.[257] When Puyi asked for her forgiveness, she told him \"It\\'s all over now, let\\'s not talk about it\", causing him to break down in tears.[257] At another meeting, a woman described the mass execution of people from her village by the Japanese Army, and then declared that she did not hate the Japanese and those who had served them as she retained her faith in humanity, which greatly moved Puyi.[257] On another occasion, Jin confronted Puyi with his former concubine Li in meetings in his office, where she attacked him for seeing her only as a sex object, and saying she was now pregnant by a man who loved her.[257]\\nIn late 1956, Puyi acted in a play, The Defeat of the Aggressors, about the Suez Crisis, playing the role of a left-wing Labour MP who challenges in the House of Commons a former Manchukuo minister playing the Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd.[258] Puyi enjoyed the role[259] and continued acting in plays about his life and Manchukuo; in one he played a Manchukuo functionary and kowtowed to a portrait of himself as Emperor of Manchukuo.[259] During the Great Leap Forward, when millions of people starved to death in China, Jin chose to cancel Puyi\\'s visits to the countryside lest the scenes of famine undo his growing faith in communism.[260] Behr wrote that many are surprised that Puyi\\'s \"remodelling\" worked, with an Emperor brought up as almost a god becoming content to be just an ordinary man, but he noted that \"...\\xa0it is essential to remember that Puyi was not alone in undergoing such successful \\'remolding\\'. Tough KMT generals, and even tougher Japanese generals, brought up in the samurai tradition and the bushido cult which glorifies death in battle and sacrifice to martial Japan, became, in Fushun, just as devout in their support of communist ideals as Puyi\".[261]\\n\\nRelease[edit]\\nPuyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 with special permission from Mao and lived for the next six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel.[262] He had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: \"I\\'m Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty. I\\'m staying with relatives and can\\'t find my way home\".[263] One of Puyi\\'s first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist; he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth.[264] He voiced his support for the Communists and worked as a gardener at the Beijing Botanical Gardens. The role brought Puyi a degree of happiness he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy.[265]\\nBehr noted that in Europe, people who played roles analogous to the role Puyi played in Manchukuo were generally executed; for example, the British hanged William Joyce for being the announcer on the English-language broadcasts of Radio Berlin, the Italians shot Benito Mussolini, and the French executed Pierre Laval, so many Westerners are surprised that Puyi was released from prison after only nine years to start a new life.[266] Behr wrote that the Communist ideology explained this difference, writing: \"In a society where all landlord and \\'capitalist-roaders\\' were evil incarnate, it did not matter so much that Puyi was also a traitor to his country: he was, in the eyes of the Communist ideologues, only behaving true to type. If all capitalists and landlords were, by their very nature, traitors, it was only logical that Puyi, the biggest landlord, should also be the biggest traitor. And, in the last resort, Puyi was far more valuable alive than dead\".[266]\\nIn early 1960, Puyi met Premier Zhou Enlai, who told him: \"You weren\\'t responsible for becoming Emperor at the age of three or the 1917 attempted restoration coup. But you were fully to blame for what happened later. You knew perfectly well what you were doing when you took refuge in the Legation Quarter, when you travelled under Japanese protection to Tianjin, and when you agreed to become Manchukuo Chief Executive.\"[265] Puyi responded by merely saying that though he did not choose to be an emperor, he had behaved with savage cruelty as boy-emperor and wished he could apologize to all the eunuchs he had flogged during his youth.[265]\\nAt the age of 56, he married Li Shuxian, a hospital nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death, he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan.[267] Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: \"I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love and was ready to give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs\".[268] Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: \"Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: \\'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die\\'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?\".[268] Puyi showed remorse for his past actions, often telling her that \"[y]esterday\\'s Puyi is the enemy of today\\'s Puyi\".[269]\\n\\nPuyi in 1961, flanked by Xiong Bingkun, a commander in the Wuchang uprising, and Lu Zhonglin, who took part in Puyi\\'s expulsion from the Forbidden City in 1924.\\nIn the spring of 1967 Pujie and Hiro Saga visited Puyi, who was by then seriously ill\\nIn the 1960s, with encouragement from Mao and Zhou, and the public endorsement of the Chinese government, Puyi wrote his autobiography From Emperor to Citizen (Chinese: 我的前半生; pinyin: Wǒdè Qián Bànshēng; Wade–Giles: Wo Te Ch\\'ien Pan-Sheng; lit. \\'The First Half of My Life\\') together with Li Wenda, an editor at the People\\'s Publishing Bureau. The ghostwriter Li had initially planned to use Puyi\\'s \"autocritique\" written in Fushun as the basis of the book, expecting the job to take only a few months, but it used such wooden language as Puyi confessed to a career of abject cowardice, that Li was forced to start anew. It took four years to write the book.[270] Puyi said of his testimony at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal:[271]\\n\\nI now feel very ashamed of my testimony, as I withheld some of what I knew to protect myself from being punished by my country. I said nothing about my secret collaboration with the Japanese imperialists over a long period, an association to which my open capitulation after 18 September 1931 was but the conclusion. Instead, I spoke only of the way the Japanese had put pressure on me and forced me to do their will.\\nI maintained that I had not betrayed my country but had been kidnapped; denied all my collaboration with the Japanese; and even claimed that the letter I had written to Jirō Minami was a fake.[108] I covered up my crimes to protect myself.\\nPuyi objected to Pujie\\'s attempt to reunite with Lady Saga, who had returned to Japan, writing to Zhou asking him to block Lady Saga from coming back to China, which led Zhou to reply: \"The war\\'s over, you know. You don\\'t have to carry this national hatred into your own family.\"[272] Behr concluded: \"It is difficult to avoid the impression that Puyi, in an effort prove himself a \\'remolded man\\', displayed the same craven attitude towards the power-holders of the new China that he had shown in Manchukuo towards the Japanese.\"[272]\\nMany of the claims in From Emperor to Citizen, like the statement that it was the Kuomintang who stripped Manchuria bare of industrial equipment in 1945–46 rather than the Soviets, together with an \"unreservedly rosy picture of prison life\", are widely known to be false, but the book was translated into foreign languages and sold well. Behr wrote: \"The more fulsome, cliché-ridden chapters in From Emperor to Citizen, dealing with Puyi\\'s prison experiences, and written at the height of the Mao personality cult, give the impression of well-learned, regurgitated lessons.\"[273]\\n\\nPuyi in the 1960s with Li Shuxian and Pujie in Beijing\\nFrom 1963 onward, Puyi regularly gave press conferences praising life in the People\\'s Republic of China, and foreign diplomats often sought him out, curious to meet the famous \"Last Emperor\" of China.[274] In an interview with Behr, Li Wenda told him that Puyi was a very clumsy man who \"invariably forgot to close doors behind him, forgot to flush the toilet, forgot to turn the tap off after washing his hands, had a genius for creating an instant, disorderly mess around him\".[275] Puyi had been so used to having his needs catered to that he never entirely learned how to function on his own.[275]\\nHe tried very hard to be modest and humble, always being the last person to board a bus, which meant that on one occasion he missed the ride, mistaking the bus conductor for a passenger. In restaurants he would tell waitresses, \"You should not be serving me. I should be serving you.\"[275] During this period, Puyi was known for his kindness, and once after he accidentally knocked down an elderly lady with his bicycle, he visited her every day in the hospital to bring her flowers to make amends until she was released.[276]\\n\\nDeath[edit]\\nThe Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966, and the Red Guards that had been encouraged by Mao saw Puyi, who symbolised imperial China, as an easy target. Puyi was placed under protection by the local public security bureau and, although his food rations, salary, and various luxuries, including his sofa and desk, were removed, he was not publicly humiliated as was common at the time. The Red Guards attacked Puyi for his book From Emperor to Citizen because it had been translated into English and French, which displeased the Red Guards and led to copies of the book being burned in the streets.[277] Various members of the Qing family, including Pujie, had their homes raided and burned by Red Guards, but Zhou Enlai used his influence to protect Puyi and the rest of the Qing from the worst abuses inflicted by the Red Guard.[278] Jin Yuan, the man who had \"remodelled\" Puyi in the 1950s, fell victim to the Red Guard and became a prisoner in Fushun for several years, while Li Wenda, who had ghostwritten From Emperor to Citizen, spent seven years in solitary confinement.[279] However, Puyi\\'s health began to decline. He died in Beijing of complications arising from kidney cancer and heart disease on 17 October 1967 at the age of 61.[280]\\nIn accordance with the laws of the People\\'s Republic of China at the time, Puyi\\'s body was cremated. His ashes were first placed at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, alongside those of other party and state dignitaries. (This was the burial ground of imperial concubines and eunuchs prior to the establishment of the People\\'s Republic of China.) In 1995, as a part of a commercial arrangement, Puyi\\'s ashes were transferred by his widow Li Shuxian to the Hualong Imperial Cemetery (华龙皇家陵园)[281] in return for monetary support. The cemetery is near the Western Qing Tombs, 120\\xa0km (75\\xa0mi) southwest of Beijing, where four of the nine Qing emperors preceding him are interred, along with three empresses and 69 princes, princesses, and imperial concubines. In 2015, some descendants of the Aisin-Gioro clan bestowed posthumous names upon Puyi and his wives. Wenxiu and Li Yuqin were not given posthumous names as their imperial status was removed upon divorce.[282]\\n\\nTitles, honours, and decorations[edit]\\nTitles[edit]\\nStyles ofXuantong EmperorReference styleHis Imperial MajestySpoken styleYour Imperial MajestyAlternative styleSon of Heaven\\nWhen he ruled as emperor of the Qing dynasty (and therefore emperor of China) from 1908 to 1912 and during his brief restoration in 1917, Puyi\\'s era name was \"Xuantong\", so he was known as the \"Xuantong Emperor\" (simplified Chinese: 宣统皇帝; traditional Chinese: 宣統皇帝; pinyin: Xuāntǒng Huángdì; Wade–Giles: Hsüan1-t\\'ung3 Huang2-ti4) during those two periods. Puyi was also allowed to retain his title as Emperor of the Great Qing, being treated like a foreign monarch by the Republic of China until 5 November 1924.\\nAs Puyi was also the last ruling emperor of China, he is widely known as \"the last emperor\" (Chinese: 末代皇帝; pinyin: Mòdài Huángdì; Wade–Giles: Mo4-tai4 Huang2-ti4) in China and throughout the rest of the world. Some refer to him as \"the last emperor of the Qing dynasty\" (Chinese: 清末帝; pinyin: Qīng Mò Dì; Wade–Giles: Ch\\'ing1 Mo4-ti4).\\nDue to his abdication, Puyi is also known as the \"yielded emperor\" (Chinese: 遜帝; pinyin: Xùn Dì) or \"abrogated emperor\" (simplified Chinese: 废帝; traditional Chinese: 廢帝; pinyin: Fèi Dì). Sometimes, the character \"Qing\" (Chinese: 清; pinyin: Qīng) is added in front of the two titles to indicate his affiliation with the Qing dynasty.\\nWhen Puyi ruled the puppet state of Manchukuo and assumed the title of Chief Executive of the new state, his era name was \"Datong\". As emperor of Manchukuo from 1934 to 1945, his era name was \"Kangde\", so he was known as the \"Kangde emperor\" (Chinese: 康德皇帝; pinyin: Kāngdé Huángdì, Japanese: Kōtoku Kōtei) during that period of time.\\n\\nHonours and decorations[edit]\\nQing Dynasty\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Peacock Feather\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Blue Feather\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Double Dragon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Imperial Throne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Yellow Dragon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Red Dragon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Blue Dragon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Black Dragon\\n\\n\\nManchukuo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrand Order of the Orchid Blossom\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Illustrious Dragon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Auspicious Clouds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Pillars of State\\n\\n\\nForeign\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (Italy)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, 1st Class (Italy)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy (Italy)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (Japan)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of the Paulownia Flowers (Japan)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of Carol I (Romania)\\n\\n\\nFamily[edit]\\nMain article: Family of Puyi\\nPortrayal in media[edit]\\nFilm[edit]\\nThe Last Emperor, a 1986 Hong Kong film directed by Li Han-hsiang.

Thus,\\xa0solving AI alignment will\\xa0not necessarily lead to utopia.\\n\\nOthers have raised similar concerns before.[2]\\xa0Joe Carlsmith puts it especially well in the post “An even deeper atheism”:\\n\\n> “And now, of course, the question arises: how different, exactly, are\\xa0human hearts from each other? And in particular: are they sufficiently different that, when they foom, and even \"on reflection,\" they don\\'t end up pointing in exactly the same direction? After all, Yudkowsky said, above, that in order for the future to be non-trivially \"of worth,\" human hearts have to be in the driver\\'s seat. But even setting aside the insult, here, to the dolphins, bonobos, nearest grabby aliens, and so on – still, that\\'s only to specify a\\xa0necessary condition. Presumably, though, it\\'s not a sufficient condition? Presumably\\xa0some human hearts would be bad drivers, too? Like, I dunno, Stalin?”\\n\\n\\nWhat makes human hearts bad?\\xa0\\n\\nWhat, exactly, makes some human hearts bad drivers? If we better understood what makes hearts go bad, perhaps we could figure out how to make bad hearts good or at least learn how to prevent hearts from going bad. It would also allow us better spot potentially bad hearts and coordinate our efforts to prevent them from taking the driving seat.\\n\\nAs of now, I’m most worried about\\xa0malevolent\\xa0personality traits and\\xa0fanatical ideologies.[3]\\n\\nMalevolence: dangerous personality traits\\n\\nSome human hearts may be corrupted due to elevated\\xa0malevolent traits like psychopathy, sadism, narcissism, Machiavellianism, or spitefulness.\\n\\nIdeological fanaticism: dangerous belief systems\\n\\nThere are many suitable definitions of “ideological fanaticism”. Whatever definition we are going to use, it should describe ideologies that have caused immense harm historically, such as\\xa0fascism (Germany under Hitler, Italy under Mussolini), (extreme)\\xa0communism (the Soviet Union under Stalin, China under Mao),\\xa0religious fundamentalism (ISIS, the Inquisition), and most cults.\\xa0\\n\\nSee this footnote[4]\\xa0for a preliminary list of defining characteristics.\\n\\n\\nMalevolence and fanaticism seem especially dangerous\\n\\nOf course, there are other factors that could corrupt our hearts or driving ability. For example, cognitive biases, limited cognitive ability,\\xa0philosophical confusions, or plain old selfishness.[5]\\xa0I’m most concerned about malevolence and ideological fanaticism for two reasons.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nDeliberately resisting reflection and idealization\\n\\nFirst, malevolence—if reflectively endorsed[6]—and fanatical ideologies\\xa0deliberately resist being changed and would thus plausibly resist idealization even during a\\xa0long reflection. The most central characteristic of fanatical ideologies is arguably that they explicitly forbid criticism, questioning, and belief change and view doubters and disagreement as evil.\\xa0\\n\\nPutting positive value on creating harm\\n\\nSecond, malevolence and ideological fanaticism would not only result in the future not being as good as it possibly could—they might\\xa0actively steer the future in bad directions and, for instance, result in\\xa0astronomical amounts of suffering.\\xa0\\n\\nThe preferences of malevolent humans (e.g., sadists) may be such that they intrinsically enjoy inflicting suffering on others. Similarly, many fanatical ideologies sympathize with\\xa0excessive retributivism and often demonize the outgroup. Enabled by future technology, preferences for inflicting suffering on the outgroup may result in enormous disvalue—cf. concentration camps, the Gulag, or\\xa0hell[7].\\n\\nIn the future, I hope to write more about all of this, especially long-term risks from ideological fanaticism.\\xa0\\n\\nThanks to Pablo and Ruairi for comments and valuable discussions.\\xa0\\n\\n 1. ^\\n    \\n    “Human misalignment” is arguably a confusing (and perhaps confused) term. But it sounds more sophisticated than “bad human values”.\\xa0\\n\\n 2. ^\\n    \\n    For example, Matthew Barnett in “AI alignment shouldn\\'t be conflated with AI moral achievement”, Geoffrey Miller in “AI alignment with humans... but with which humans?”, lc in “Aligned AI is dual use technology”. Pablo Stafforini\\xa0has called this the “third alignment problem”. And of course, Yudkowsky’s concept of\\xa0CEV is meant to address these issues.\\xa0\\n\\n 3. ^\\n    \\n    These factors may not be clearly separable. Some humans may be more attracted to fanatical ideologies due to their psychological traits and malevolent humans are often leading fanatical ideologies. Also, believing and following a fanatical ideology may not be good for your heart.\\n\\n 4. ^\\n    \\n    Below are some typical characteristics (I’m no expert in this area):\\n    \\n    Unquestioning belief, absolute certainty and rigid adherence. The principles and beliefs of the ideology are seen as absolute truth and questioning or critical examination is forbidden.\\n    \\n    Inflexibility and refusal to compromise.\\xa0\\n    \\n    Intolerance and hostility towards dissent. Anyone who disagrees or challenges the ideology is seen as evil; as enemies, traitors, or heretics.\\n    \\n    Ingroup superiority and outgroup demonization. The in-group is viewed as superior, chosen, or enlightened. The out-group is often demonized and blamed for the world\\'s problems.\\xa0\\n    \\n    Authoritarianism. Fanatical ideologies often endorse (or even require) a strong, centralized authority to enforce their principles and suppress opposition, potentially culminating in dictatorship or totalitarianism.\\n    \\n    Militancy and willingness to use violence.\\n    \\n    Utopian vision. Many fanatical ideologies are driven by a vision of a perfect future or afterlife which can only be achieved through strict adherence to the ideology. This utopian vision often justifies extreme measures in the present.\\xa0\\n    \\n    Use of propaganda and censorship.\\xa0\\n\\n 5. ^\\n    \\n    For example, Barnett\\xa0argues that future technology will be primarily used to satisfy economic consumption (aka selfish desires). That seems even plausible to me, however, I’m not that concerned about this causing huge amounts of future suffering (at least compared to other s-risks). It seems to me that most humans place non-trivial value on the welfare of (neutral) others such as animals. Right now, this preference (for most people) isn’t strong enough to outweigh the selfish benefits of eating meat. However, I’m relatively hopeful that future technology would make such types of tradeoffs much less costly.\\xa0\\n\\n 6. ^\\n    \\n    Some people (how many?) with elevated malevolent traits don’t reflectively endorse their malevolent urges and would change them if they could. However, some of them do reflectively endorse their malevolent preferences and view empathy as weakness.\\xa0\\n\\n 7. ^\\n    \\n    Some quotes from famous Christian theologians:\\xa0\\n    \\n    Thomas Aquinas:\\xa0 \"the blessed will rejoice in the punishment of the wicked.\" \"In order that the happiness of the saints may be more delightful to them and that they may render more copious thanks to God for it, they are allowed to see perfectly the sufferings of the damned\".\\xa0\\n    \\n    Samuel Hopkins:\\xa0 \"Should the fire of this eternal punishment cease, it would in a great measure obscure the light of heaven, and put an end to a great part of the happiness and glory of the blessed.”\\n    \\n    Jonathan Edwards:\\xa0 \"The sight of hell torments will exalt the happiness of the saints forever.\"51Linch4d14My default story is one where government actors eventually take an increasing (likely dominant) role in the development of AGI. Some assumptions behind this default story:\\n\\n1. AGI progress continues to be fairly concentrated among a small number of actors, even as AI becomes percentage points of GDP.\\n\\n2. Takeoff speeds (from the perspective of the State) are relatively slow.\\n\\n3. Timelines are moderate to long (after 2030 say).\\xa0\\n\\nIf what I say is broadly correct, I think this may have has some underrated downstream implications For example, we may be currently overestimating the role of values or insitutional processes of labs, or the value of getting gov\\'ts to intervene(since the default outcome is that they\\'d intervene anyway). Conversely, we may be underestimating the value of clear conversations about AI that government actors or the general public can easily understand (since if they\\'ll intervene anyway, we want the interventions to be good). More speculatively, we may also be underestimating the value of making sure 2-3 are true (if you share my belief that gov\\'t actors will broadly be more responsible than the existing corporate actors).\\n\\nHappy to elaborate if this is interesting.31John Salter4dAI safetyOpportunitiesExistential risk0Y-Combinator wants to fund Mechanistic Interpretability startups\\n\\n\"Understanding model behavior is very challenging, but we believe that in contexts where trust is paramount it is essential for an AI model to be interpretable.

At the slightest hint of danger, these resources should be distributed to every part of the country. There should be enough stock to protect the people for as long as is required to get resupplied.\\n\\nThe Australians have a national medical stockpile and they started distributing masks from it in January 2020 in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. The French used to have a national stockpile of masks, but they decided it would be more ‘efficient’ to get rid of it, reasoning that if there was an emergency, they could just buy masks from China. Sacre bleu!\\n\\nStockpiling is a general-purpose risk management technique which also works for other emergencies such as terrorism, fires, nuclear fallout, and war. If you want to survive in the long-run, you need to build stockpiles!Load morePopular commentsLoad moreRecent discussionVasco Grilo commented on New Open Philanthropy Grantmaking Program: Forecasting now84New Open Philanthropy Grantmaking Program: ForecastingOpen PhilanthropyOpen Philanthropy+ 0 more · 3d\\xa0ago · 2m read23This is a linkpost for https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-grantmaking-program-forecasting/Written by Benjamin TereickWe are happy to announce that we have added\\xa0forecasting as an official grantmaking\\xa0focus area.

For context, readers may want to check the question post Why is EA so enthusiastic about forecasting?.4MaxRa4hI agree that things like confirmation bias and myside bias are huge drivers impeding \"societal sanity\". And I also agree that it won\\'t help a lot here to develop tools to refine probabilities slightly more.\\n\\nThat said, I think there is a huge crowd of reasonably sane people who have never interacted with the idea of quantified forecasting as a useful epistemic practice and a potential ideal to thrive towards when talking about important future developments. Like other commentators say, it\\'s currently mostly attracting a niche of people who thrive for higher epistemic ideals, who try to contribute to better forecasts on important topics, etc. I currently feel like it\\'s not intractable for quantitative forecasts to become more common in epistemic spaces filled with reasonable enough people (e.g. journalism, politics, academia). Kinda similar to how tracking KPIs where probably once a niche new practice and are now standard practice.Rethink Priorities commented on Who\\'s hiring? (Feb-May 2024) 17m ago43Who\\'s hiring?

I realize that I really wasn\\'t clear, and that it probably does exist more in EA than my instinctive impression (also - great links, I hadn\\'t been familiar with all of them).\\n\\nWhat I meant by leverage was more along the lines of \"the value of insider\\'s perspective and the ability to leverage individual networks and skill sets\". In these cases, Nick was able to identify potential cost-effective ways to save lives because of both his training and location, and SACH is able to similarly have a cost-effective program because of their close connections with a hospital. I have a few other examples as well, such as NALA\\'s WASH on Wheel\\'s program (which essentially trains a team a plumbers and provides access to clean water to hundreds of program, leveraging the existing infrastructure), and anecdotes I\\'ve heard about people on the ground being able to provide crucial solutions during the current Israel-Hamas crisis.\\n\\nI have a sense that the classic EA (and I could very much be strawmanning here) thinks along the lines of: big problems, good solutions, niche area - but doesn\\'t think about who is best placed to identify or implement even better solutions that can come up because the world is messy.\\n\\nAfter thinking about it, the \"leverage\" I\\'m referring to is probably more common than I thought, but maybe not so very well defined.\\xa01ezrah10hFrom what I understand, the per-patient treatments costs are both quite low and are given pro-bono, so given how GiveWell understands leverage (which @Mo Putera pointed out in the response below), they should be strongly discounted from the costs.

He was a central figure in the\\n\\n1905 Revolution,\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nOctober Revolution,\\n\\nRussian Civil War, and\\n\\nthe establishment of the\\n\\nSoviet Union. Alongside\\n\\nVladimir Lenin, Trotsky was widely considered the most prominent Soviet figure and was\\n\\nde facto\\n\\nsecond-in-command during the early years of the\\n\\nRussian Soviet Republic. Ideologically a\\n\\nMarxist and a\\n\\nLeninist, his thought and writings inspired a school of Marxism known as\\n\\nTrotskyism.\\n\\nYanovka in what was then the\\n\\nRussian Empire, Trotsky was initially a\\n\\nnarodnik, but embraced Marxism soon after moving to\\n\\nNikolayev in 1896. In 1898, he was arrested for revolutionary activities and exiled to\\n\\nSiberia, but in 1902 escaped to London, where he met Lenin and wrote for the\\n\\nRussian Social Democratic Labour Party\\'s paper\\n\\nIskra\\n\\nJulius Martov\\'s\\n\\nMensheviks against Lenin\\'s\\n\\nBolsheviks during the party\\'s 1903 split, but was non-factional from 1904. During the\\n\\n1905 Revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia and became chairman of the\\n\\nSaint Petersburg Soviet. He was again exiled to Siberia, but escaped in 1907 and spent time in London, Vienna, Switzerland, Paris, and New York. After the\\n\\nFebruary Revolution of 1917, which\\n\\noverthrew the tsar, Trotsky returned to Russia and joined the Bolsheviks. As chairman of the\\n\\nPetrograd Soviet, he played an important role in the October Revolution that overthrew the\\n\\nProvisional Government.\\n\\nLenin\\'s first government, Trotsky was appointed the\\n\\nPeople\\'s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and led the negotiations for the\\n\\nTreaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which Russia withdrew from\\n\\nWorld War I. From 1918 to 1925, he served as the\\n\\nPeople\\'s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, founding the\\n\\nRed Army; establishing conscription, training, and discipline; and leading it to victory in the\\n\\nRussian Civil War. In 1922, Trotsky and Lenin formed an alliance against the emerging\\n\\nSoviet bureaucracy;\\n\\n[5]\\n\\nDeputy Chairman at the\\n\\nCouncil of People\\'s Commissars, but he declined the post.\\n\\n[6]\\n\\n[7]\\n\\n[8]\\n\\nNew Economic Policy, Trotsky led the party\\'s\\n\\nLeft Opposition, which advocated a programme of rapid\\n\\nindustrialisation,\\n\\nvoluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and expansion of\\n\\nworkers\\' democracy. After Lenin\\'s death in 1924, Trotsky was outmaneuvered by\\n\\nJoseph Stalin and his allies and lost his positions: he was expelled from the Politburo in 1926 and from the party in 1927, internally exiled to\\n\\nAlma Ata in 1928, and deported in 1929. He lived in Turkey, France, and Norway before settling in Mexico in 1937.\\n\\nStalinism, supporting\\n\\nproletarian internationalism against Stalin\\'s theory of \"\\n\\nsocialism in one country\". Trotsky\\'s own theory of \"\\n\\npermanent revolution\" posited that the revolution could only survive if extended to advanced capitalist countries. In\\n\\nThe Revolution Betrayed\\n\\ndegenerated workers\\' state\" due to its isolation, and called for an end to Stalin\\'s bureaucratic dictatorship. He founded the\\n\\nFourth International in 1938 as an alternative to the\\n\\nComintern. In 1936, Trotsky was sentenced to death\\n\\nin absentia\\n\\nMoscow show trials, and in 1940, he was assassinated at his home in Mexico City by\\n\\nNKVD agent\\n\\nRamón Mercader.\\n\\npolitical rehabilitation from later leaders. In\\n\\nthe Western world, he emerged as a hero of the\\n\\nanti-Stalinist left for his defense of a more\\n\\ndemocratic,\\n\\ninternationalist form of\\n\\nsocialism\\n\\n[9]\\n\\ntotalitarianism and\\n\\nintellectual contributions to\\n\\nleft-wing movements. Whilst some of his\\n\\nwartime measures have proved controversial and have been criticised along with his ideological defence of the\\n\\nRed Terror. Modern scholarship generally ranks his leadership of the Red Army highly among historical figures and he is credited for his major involvement with the\\n\\nmilitary,\\n\\neconomic,\\n\\ncultural\\n\\n[10]\\n\\n[11]\\n\\npolitical development of the Soviet Union.\\n\\nChildhood and family (1879–1895)[edit]\\n\\n[12]\\n\\nKherson governorate,\\n\\nRussian Empire (now\\n\\nBereslavka, Ukraine).

Because of their marriage, Trotsky and his wife were allowed to be exiled to the same location in Siberia. They were exiled to Ust-Kut and the Verkholensk in the Baikal Lake region of Siberia.

and other editors of\\n\\n[14]\\n\\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of Iskra were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by Plekhanov and the \"new guard\" led by Lenin and Martov. Plekhanov\\'s supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within Iskra, expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:\\n\\nI suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt \\'Pero\\' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number) and as an addition to our forces. \\'Pero\\' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works, in general, most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.[44]\\n\\nBecause of Plekhanov\\'s opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But from then on, he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov\\'s enmity.\\n\\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met Natalia Sedova (1882–1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, Lev Sedov (1906–1938) and Sergei Sedov (1908–1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons\\' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\\n\\nIn order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for \"citizenship\" requirements, took on the name of my wife.[45]\\n\\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name \"Sedova-Trotskaya\".\\n\\nSplit with Lenin (1903–1904)[edit]\\n\\nFirst Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898,\\n\\nSecond Congress in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other\\n\\nJewish Bund, which had co-founded the\\n\\nRussian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.\\n\\n[46]\\n\\nShortly after that, the pro-Iskra delegates unexpectedly split into two factions. The split was initially over an organisational issue. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party where only party members would be seen as members, while Martov and his supporters, the Mensheviks, argued for a bigger and less disciplined party where people who assisted the party would also be seen as members. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.[47]\\n\\nFrom 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a \"non-factional social democrat\". He worked between 1904 and 1917, trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. During these years, Trotsky began developing his theory of permanent revolution and developed a close working relationship with Alexander Parvus in 1904–07.[48]\\n\\nMikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin\\'s novel\\n\\nThe Golovlyov Family\\n\\n[49]\\n\\n[50]\\n\\n[51]\\n\\n[52]\\n\\n1905 revolution and trial (1905–1906)[edit]\\n\\nThe unrest and agitation against the Russian government came to a head in Saint Petersburg on 3 January 1905 (Julian Calendar), when a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in the city. This single strike grew into a general strike, and by 7 January 1905, there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg.[53]\\n\\nOn Sunday, 9 January 1905, Father Georgi Gapon knowingly led a procession of radicals mixed within larger groups of ordinary working citizens through the streets to the Winter Palace to supposedly beseech the Tsar for food and relief from the government. According to Gapon himself, he led the people into a Palace Guard already on the defensive due to the crowd instigating violence against them. They eventually fired on the demonstration, resulting in the deaths of an unknown number of violent radicals, peaceful demonstrators and police caught within the melee. Although Sunday, 9 January 1905, became known as Bloody Sunday, Gapon\\'s own biography points to a conspiracy. This was later confirmed by Russian police records listing the number of known militant radicals found among the dead.[54][55]\\n\\nKiev.\\n\\n[56]\\n\\nCentral Committee member\\n\\nLeonid Krasin, and the local Menshevik committee, which he pushed in a more radical direction. The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural\\n\\nFinland. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution.\\n\\n[57]\\n\\nOn 19 September 1905, the typesetters at the Ivan Sytin\\'s printing house in Moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay. By the evening of 24 September, the workers at 50 other printing shops in Moscow were also on strike. On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers. On 7 October 1905, the railway workers of the Moscow–Kazan Railway went out on strike.[58] Amid the resulting confusion, Trotsky returned from Finland to Saint Petersburg on 15 October 1905. On that day, Trotsky spoke before the Saint Petersburg Soviet Council of Workers Deputies, which was meeting at the Technological Institute in the city. Also attending were some 200,000 people crowded outside to hear the speeches—about half of all workers in Saint Petersburg.[59]\\n\\nAfter his return, Trotsky and Parvus took over the newspaper Russian Gazette, increasing its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded, together with Parvus and Julius Martov and other Mensheviks, \"Nachalo\" (\"The Beginning\"), which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in 1905.[60]\\n\\nJust before Trotsky\\'s return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had: an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital\\'s workers, the first Soviet (\"Council\") of Workers. By the time of Trotsky\\'s arrival, the Saint Petersburg Soviet was already functioning, headed by Khrustalyev-Nosar (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov). Khrustalyev-Nosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the Soviet.[61]\\n\\nHowever, since his election, he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks\\' original opposition to him. Khrustalev-Nosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the Saint Petersburg Soviet.[62] Indeed, to the outside world, Khrustalev-Nosar was the embodiment of the Saint Petersburg Soviet.[61] Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name \"Yanovsky\" (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar\\'s arrest on 26 November 1905, was elected its chairman. On 2 December, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts:[63]\\n\\nThe autocracy never enjoyed the confidence of the people and was never granted any authority by the people. We have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of such loans as have been made by the Tsarist government when openly engaged in a war with the entire people.\\n\\nThe following day, on 3 December 1905, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested.[64] Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. On 4 October 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to Siberia.\\n\\nSecond emigration (1907–1914)[edit]\\n\\nAlexander Parvus (left) and\\n\\nLeo Deutsch (right) in Saint Peter and Paul Fortress prison at Saint Petersburg in 1906\\n\\nObdorsk, Siberia, in January 1907, Trotsky escaped at\\n\\nBerezov\\n\\n[65]\\n\\n5th Congress of the RSDLP. In October, he moved to\\n\\nVienna, Austria-Hungary. For the next seven years, he often took part in the activities of the\\n\\nAustrian Social Democratic Party and, occasionally, of the\\n\\nGerman Social Democratic Party.\\n\\n[46]\\n\\nIn Vienna, Trotsky became close to Adolph Joffe, his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to psychoanalysis.[66]\\n\\nIn October 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of Pravda (\"Truth\"), a bi-weekly, Russian-language social democratic paper for Russian workers, which he co-edited with Adolph Joffe and Matvey Skobelev. It was smuggled into Russia.[67] The paper appeared very irregularly; only five issues were published in its first year.[67]\\n\\nAvoiding factional politics, the paper proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905–1907 revolution. Money was very scarce for the publication of Pravda. Trotsky approached the Russian Central Committee to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909.[68]\\n\\nA majority of Bolsheviks controlled the Central Committee in 1910. Lenin agreed to the financing of \"Pravda\", but required a Bolshevik to be appointed as co-editor of the paper.[68] When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in Paris over Lenin\\'s objections,[69] Trotsky\\'s Pravda was made a party-financed \\'central organ\\'. Lev Kamenev, Trotsky\\'s brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910. Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing Pravda for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.[27]\\n\\nThe Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912 and also called it Pravda. Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper\\'s name that in April 1913, he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the message was intercepted by the Russian secret police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin\\'s death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky\\'s opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin\\'s enemy.[14]\\n\\nThe 1910s were a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP, leading to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of \"expropriations\",[70] i.e., armed robbery of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party. These actions had been banned by the 5th Congress, but were continued by the Bolsheviks.\\n\\nIn January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction, led by Lenin, as well as a few defecting Mensheviks, held a conference in Prague and decided to break away from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and formed a new party, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In response, Trotsky organized a \"unification\" conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. \"The August Bloc\") and tried to re-unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks into one party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.[46]\\n\\n[71]\\n\\nBalkan Wars for the next year. While there, Trotsky chronicled the ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbian army against the Albanian civilian population.\\n\\n[72]\\n\\nChristian Rakovsky, later a leading Soviet politician and Trotsky\\'s ally in the Soviet Communist Party. On 3 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, in which\\n\\nAustria-Hungary fought against the Russian Empire, Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral Switzerland to avoid arrest as a Russian\\n\\némigré.\\n\\n[32]\\n\\nWorld War I (1914–1917)[edit]\\n\\nThe outbreak of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism, redividing the party into defeatists and defencists. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions that saw defeat for your own country\\'s ruling class imperialists as the \"lesser evil\" in the war, while they opposed all imperialists in the imperialist war. These anti-war believers were known as \"defeatists\". Those who supported one side over the other in the war were known as \"defencists\". Plekhanov and many other defencist social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent and wanted them to win the war, while Trotsky\\'s ex-colleague Parvus, now a defencist, sided against Russia so strongly that he wanted Germany to win the war. In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the Swiss Socialist Party, prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, The War and the International,[73] and the pro-war position taken by the European social democratic parties, primarily the German party.\\n\\nAs a war correspondent for the Kievskaya Mysl, Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) Nashe Slovo (\"Our Word\"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of \"peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered.\" Lenin advocated Russia\\'s defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the Second International.[74]\\n\\nTrotsky attended the Zimmerwald Conference of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a Third International. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky\\'s resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.[75]\\n\\n[76]\\n\\nThe Bronx.

He left New York on 27 March 1917, but his ship, the\\n\\nSS Kristianiafjord,\\n\\nBritish naval officials in Canada at\\n\\nHalifax, Nova Scotia. He was detained for a month at\\n\\nAmherst Internment Camp in\\n\\nNova Scotia. While imprisoned in the camp, Trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates, describing his month at the camp as \"one continual mass meeting\".\\n\\n[78]\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of German officer inmates who complained to the British camp commander, Colonel Morris, about Trotsky\\'s \"anti-patriotic\" attitude.[78] Morris then forbade Trotsky to make any more public speeches, leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against Morris\\' order.[78] Back in Russia, after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers\\' and peasants\\' Soviets, the Russian foreign minister Pavel Milyukov was compelled to demand the release of Trotsky as a Russian citizen, and the British government freed him on 29 April 1917.[78]\\n\\nHe reached Russia on 17 May 1917. After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the Mezhraiontsy, a regional social democratic organization in Petrograd, and became one of its leaders. At the First Congress of Soviets in June, he was elected a member of the first All-Russian Central Executive Committee (\"VTsIK\") from the Mezhraiontsy faction.[79]\\n\\nAfter an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in Petrograd, Trotsky was arrested on 7 August 1917. He was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary uprising by Lavr Kornilov. After the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the Petrograd Soviet, Trotsky was elected chairman on 8 October\\xa0[O.S. 25 September]\\xa01917.[80]\\n\\nTrotsky sided with Lenin against Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev when the Bolshevik Central Committee discussed staging an armed uprising, and he led the efforts to overthrow the Russian Provisional Government headed by socialist Aleksandr Kerensky.\\n\\nJoseph Stalin in\\n\\n[81]\\n\\n[81]\\n\\n[82]\\n\\nAll practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the President of the Petrograd Soviet. It can be stated with certainty that the Party is indebted primarily and principally to Comrade Trotsky for the rapid going over of the garrison to the side of the Soviet and the efficient manner in which the work of the Military Revolutionary Committee was organized.\\n\\nBolshevik insurrection on 7–8 November 1917, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a\\n\\ncounter-attack by\\n\\nCossacks under General\\n\\nPyotr Krasnov and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at\\n\\nGatchina. Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other  moderate, socialist parties. \\nTrotsky was an outspoken advocate for a predominantly Bolshevik government and was reluctant to recall Mensheviks as partners after their voluntary withdrawal from the Congress of the Soviets. However, he released several, socialist ministers from prison and neither did Trotsky nor his colleagues in 1917 wish to suppress these parties. The Bolsheviks also reserved a number of vacant seats in the Soviets and\\n\\nCentral Executive for the parties in proportion to their vote share at the Congress.\\n\\n[83]\\n\\nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries had assumed positions in Lenin\\'s government and lead commissariats in several areas. This included agriculture (\\n\\nKolegaev), property (\\n\\nKarelin), justice (\\n\\nSteinberg), post offices and telegraphs (\\n\\nProshian) and local government (Trutovsky).\\n\\n[84]\\n\\nAccording to Deutscher, the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries presented a number of demands for a coalition government. These demands proposed disarming the Bolshevik detachments and excluding Lenin and Trotsky from the coalition. This was seen as unacceptable to even the most moderate, Bolshevik negotiators such as Kamenev and Sokolnikov.[85]\\n\\nBy the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin\\'s top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading. This reversal of position contributed to continuing competition and enmity between the two men, which lasted until 1926 and did much to destroy them both.[editorializing]\\n\\nRussian Revolution and aftermath[edit]\\n\\nCommissar for Foreign Affairs and Brest-Litovsk (1917–1918)[edit]\\n\\nConstituent Assembly on 6 January 1918.

When the Soviet delegation learned that Germans and Austro-Hungarians planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, while the Baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by German princes, the talks were recessed for 12 days. The Soviets\\' only hopes were that, given time, their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt, so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote, \"To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying\".\\n\\n[86]\\n\\nBrest-Litovsk from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918.\\n\\n[87]\\n\\nLeft Communists, led by\\n\\nNikolai Bukharin, continued to believe that there could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist empire, and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace.\\n\\n[88]\\n\\n[89]\\n\\nRed Army against\\n\\nPolish forces of Gen.\\n\\nJózef Dowbor-Muśnicki in Belarus,\\n\\nWhite forces in the\\n\\nDon region, and newly independent\\n\\nUkrainian forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and\\n\\nasymmetrical warfare were used.\\n\\n[88]\\n\\nThey were willing to hold talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, reparations, etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West. Still, they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who were then the Bolsheviks\\' junior partners in a coalition government.[90]\\n\\nTreaty of Brest-Litovsk\\n\\nLenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the Imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky\\'s position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:[91]\\n\\nThat we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed Red Guard and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.\\n\\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked land grab for territories. Trotsky wrote in 1925:[92]\\n\\nWe began peace negotiations in the hope of arousing the workmen\\'s party of Germany and Austria-Hungary as well as of the Entente countries. For this reason we were obliged to delay the negotiations as long as possible to give the European workman time to understand the main fact of the Soviet revolution itself and particularly its peace policy. But there was the other question: Can the Germans still fight? Are they in a position to begin an attack on the revolution that will explain the cessation of the war? How can we find out the state of mind of the German soldiers, how to fathom it?\\n\\nTrotsky, in a letter he wrote to Lenin during the negotiations, which must have been written before January 18, 1918, described its policy, summarily, as follows:[93][94][95]\\n\\nIt is impossible to sign their peace. They already have agreed with fictitious Governments of Poland,\\n\\nLithuania,\\n\\nCourland and others concerning territorial concessions and military and customs treaties. (...)\\n\\nWe cannot sign their peace. My plan is this:\\n\\nWe announce the termination of the war and demobilization without signing any peace. We declare we cannot participate in the looting war of the Allies nor can we sign a looting peace. Poland\\'s, Lithuania\\'s and Courland\\'s fate we place upon the responsibility of the German working people.\\n\\nThe Germans will be unable to attack us after we declare the war ended. At any rate, it would be very difficult for Germany to attack us, because of her internal condition. The\\n\\nScheidemannites adopted a formal resolution to break with the Government if it makes annexationist demands of the Russian revolution.\\n\\nThe\\n\\nBerliner Tageblatt\\n\\nVossische Zeitung\\n\\nCentrists favor an agreement. (...)\\n\\nWe declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now (...)\\n\\nWe must have your decision. We can still drag on negotiations for one or two or three or four days. Afterward they must be broken off. I see no other solution than that proposed. I clasp your hand.\\n\\nYours,\\n\\nTROTZKY.\\n\\nAnswer by direct wire: \"I agree to your plan\" or \"I don\\'t agree.\"\\n\\nHowever, even though Lenin was in favor of a peace, due to party opposition, he basically responded with these messages from January 18, 1918:[96]\\n\\nMessage to Trotsky.\\n\\nStalin has just arrived; we will look into the matter with him and let you have a joint answer right away.\\n\\nLenin\\n\\nPass the following on to Trotsky: please adjourn proceedings and leave for Petrograd.\\n\\nSend a reply; I will wait.\\n\\nLenin, Stalin\\n\\nAs it was remarked by Trotsky that, \"[... p]ossibly this answer already showed that he did not agree with my proposition (...)\", Trotsky returned to Petrograd to debate with Lenin.[97] During his debate with Trotsky, Lenin concluded: \"(...) In any case, I stand for the immediate signing of peace; it is safer.\"[98]\\n\\nHowever, after debates with the German delegation, Trotsky and the Russian delegation withdrew from peace talks on 10 February 1918, by declaring ending the war on the side of Soviet Russia, and not signing a peace treaty.[99] Contrary to Russia\\'s declaration, Germany resumed military operations on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized, and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin\\'s proposal was accepted 7–4. The Soviet government sent a radiogram to the German side, taking the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.[100]\\n\\nGermany did not respond for three days and continued its offensive, encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7–4 on 23 February 1918; the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.\\n\\nHead of the Red Army (spring 1918)[edit]\\n\\nhis armoured train during the Russian Civil War in 1920\\n\\nOn 13 March 1918, Trotsky\\'s resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People\\'s Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs—in place of Podvoisky—and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over the controversial treaty of Brest-Litovsk.[90]\\n\\nNikolai Podvoisky and commander-in-chief\\n\\nNikolai Krylenko, protested vigorously against Trotsky\\'s appointment and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the\\n\\nRussian Civil War, and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky\\'s deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky\\'s side. The discontent with Trotsky\\'s policies of strict discipline, forced\\n\\nconscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the\\n\\nMilitary Opposition, which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918–1919.\\n\\n[101]\\n\\nCivil War (1918–1920)[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nRussian Civil War\\n\\n1918[edit]\\n\\nantisemitic\\n\\n[102]\\n\\nWhite Army propaganda poster depicting Trotsky as\\n\\nSatan wearing a\\n\\npentagram and portraying the\\n\\nBolsheviks\\' Chinese supporters as mass murderers. The caption reads, \"Peace and Liberty in\\n\\nSovdepiya\".\\n\\nThe military situation soon tested Trotsky\\'s managerial and organization-building skills. In May–June 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions en route from European Russia to Vladivostok rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country\\'s territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the White Army after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.[103]\\n\\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged mobilization, which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of political commissars into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the Imperial Army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:[104]\\n\\nAn army cannot be built without reprisals. Masses of men cannot be led to death unless the army command has the death-penalty in its arsenal. So long as those malicious tailless apes that are so proud of their technical achievements—the animals that we call men—will build armies and wage wars, the command will always be obliged to place the soldiers between the possible death in the front and the inevitable one in the rear. And yet armies are not built on fear. The Tsar\\'s army fell to pieces not because of any lack of reprisals. In his attempt to save it by restoring the death-penalty, Kerensky only finished it. Upon the ashes of the great war, the Bolsheviks created a new army. These facts demand no explanation for any one who has even the slightest knowledge of the language of history. The strongest cement in the new army was the ideas of the October revolution, and the train supplied the front with this cement.\\n\\nAnother controversial feature of his military decisions was to inaugurate hostage-taking of relatives of ex-Tsarist officials working in the Red Army to avert the risk of defection or betrayal.[105] Service pointed out that this practice was exercised by both Red and White armies during the Civil War.[106]\\n\\nTrotsky would later defend his decision and argue that none of the families of ex-officials who did betray the army and contribute to additional human casualties were themselves ever executed. He would also insist that had these draconian measures been adopted rather than excess “magnanimity” to opponents at the start of the October Revolution then Russia would have experienced far less casualties. [107] Deutscher draws attention to the fact that Trotsky preferred to exchange hostages and prisoners rather than execute them. He recounts that Trotsky had released General Krasnov on parole in 1918 after the Kerensky–Krasnov uprising during the initial stage of the civil war but the general would take up arms against the Soviets shortly again afterwards.[108]\\n\\nRed Terror[edit]\\n\\nassassination attempts on Vladimir Lenin and Trotsky along with the successful assassinations of Petrograd\\n\\nCheka leader\\n\\nMoisei Uritsky  and party editor\\n\\nV.

The campaign of mass repressions would officially begin thereafter.[110][112] The Red Terror is considered to have officially begun between 17 and 30 August 1918.[110][112] Regarding the Red Terror Trotsky wrote:\\n\\nThe bourgeoisie today is a falling class... We are forced to tear it off, to chop it away. The Red Terror is a weapon utilized against a class, doomed to destruction, which does not wish to perish. If the White Terror can only retard the historical rise of the proletariat, the Red Terror hastens the destruction of the bourgeoisie.[122]\\n\\nDesertions[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nDesertions\\n\\nIn dealing with deserters, Trotsky often appealed to them politically, arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.\\n\\nIn the provinces of Kaluga, Voronezh, and Ryazan, tens of thousands of young peasants had failed to answer the first recruiting summons by the Soviets ... The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. \"Something might happen,\" they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. \"Comrade-deserters—come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you.\" They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The \"comrade-deserters\" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: \"What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?\" Later on, regiments of Ryazan \"deserters\" fought well at the fronts.\\n\\nbarrier troops by the Red Army occurred in the late summer and fall of 1918 in the\\n\\nEastern front during the\\n\\nRussian Civil War, when\\n\\nPeople\\'s Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs (War Commissar) Leon Trotsky of the Communist\\n\\nBolshevik government authorized\\n\\nMikhail Tukhachevsky, the commander of the\\n\\n1st Army, to station blocking detachments behind unreliable Red Army infantry regiments in the 1st Red Army, with orders to shoot if front-line troops either deserted or retreated without permission. The barrier troops comprised personnel drawn from\\n\\nCheka punitive detachments or from regular Red Army infantry regiments.\\n\\n[123]\\n\\nIn December 1918 Trotsky ordered that detachments of additional barrier troops be raised for attachment to each infantry formation in the Red Army. On December 18 he cabled:\\n\\nHow do things stand with the blocking units? As far as I am aware they have not been included in our establishment and it appears they have no personnel. It is absolutely essential that we have at least an embryonic network of blocking units and that we work out a procedure for bringing them up to strength and deploying them.[123]\\n\\nThe barrier troops were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the Red Army, a role which soon earned them the hatred of the Russian civilian population.[124]\\n\\nDemyan Bedny near Kazan, 1918\\n\\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:\\n\\nWhen Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us! We have no other bricks! And so, we must compel the bourgeois experts, under the leadership of the proletariat, to build up our edifice with these bricks. This is what is difficult; but this is the pledge of victory.[125]\\n\\nIn September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing continuous military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the Latvian Riflemen, Ioakim Vatsetis (a.k.a. Jukums Vācietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations of the army. At the same time, Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky\\'s adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\\n\\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict, this time between Trotsky and Stalin, in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general Pavel Pavlovich Sytin to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled[by whom?] from the front. Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.\\n\\nIn 1919, 616 \"hardcore\" deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following Trotsky\\'s dracionan measures.[126] According to historian Orlando Figes, \"a majority of deserters (most registered as \"weak-willed\") were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front\". Even those registered as \"malicious\" deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate\". Forges also noted that the Red Army instituted amnesty weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged  the voluntary return of 98,000-132,000 deserters to the army.[127]\\n\\n1919[edit]\\n\\nVladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky,\\n\\nLev Kamenev motivate the troops to fight in the\\n\\nSoviet-Polish war, 1 May 1920\\n\\nThroughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky\\'s leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the VIIIth Party Congress in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first Politburo after the Congress. But he later wrote:[101]\\n\\nIt is no wonder that my military work created so many enemies for me. I did not look to the side, I elbowed away those who interfered with military success, or in the haste of the work trod on the toes of the unheeding and was too busy even to apologize. Some people remember such things. The dissatisfied and those whose feelings had been hurt found their way to Stalin or Zinoviev, for these two also nourished hurts.\\n\\nIn mid-1919, the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky\\'s leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000 and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts.[128]\\n\\nAt the 3–4 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange, the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against Vācietis and Trotsky. Trotsky\\'s plan was rejected, and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin[129] to dismiss Trotsky from his post.\\n\\nHowever, some significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, Vācietis was suddenly arrested by the Cheka on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and Tukhachevsky were defeated during the Battle of Warsaw, but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga\\'s friendship and later his support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.[130]\\n\\nBy October 1919, the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin\\'s troops approached Tula and Moscow from the south, and General Nikolay Yudenich\\'s troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued[131] that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent Estonia and Finland from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee.\\n\\n1920[edit]\\n\\nBéla Kun,\\n\\nAlfred Rosmer, Leon Trotsky,\\n\\nMikhail Frunze and\\n\\nSergey Gusev,\\n\\nKharkov, Ukraine, 1920\\n\\nWith the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government\\'s emphasis shifted to the economy. Trotsky spent the winter of 1919–20 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. A false rumor of his assassination circulated in Germany and the international press on New Year\\'s Day 1920.[132] Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of War Communism,[133] which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal.\\n\\nMikhail Kalinin and Leon Trotsky greet\\n\\nRed Army troops.\\n\\nPolish–Soviet War.\\n\\nanti-Soviet Polish poster titled \"Bolshevik freedom\" which depicts him on a pile of skulls and holding a bloody knife, during the\\n\\nPolish–Soviet War of 1920. Small caption in the lower right corner reads:\\n\\nThe Bolsheviks promised:\\n\\nWe\\'ll give you peace\\n\\nWe\\'ll give you freedom\\n\\nWe\\'ll give you land\\n\\nWork and bread\\n\\nDespicably they cheated\\n\\nThey started a\\n\\nwar\\n\\nWith Poland\\n\\nInstead of freedom they brought\\n\\nThe fist\\n\\nInstead of land – confiscation\\n\\nInstead of work – misery\\n\\nInstead of bread – famine.\\n\\nIn early 1920, Soviet–Polish tensions eventually led to the Polish–Soviet War. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued[129] that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army\\'s successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant \"The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war.\"[134]\\n\\nPoland defeated the Red Army, and the offensive was turned back during the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.\\n\\nTrade union debate (1920–1921)[edit]\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker\\'s state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for:\\n\\n\"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime. This is the militarisation of the working class.\"[135]\\n\\nVladimir Lenin and\\n\\nKlim Voroshilov among soldiers in\\n\\nPetrograd in 1921.\\n\\nLenin sharply criticized Trotsky and accused him of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\" and of staging \"factional attacks.\" His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. Bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin\\'s position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky\\'s expense.\\n\\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin\\'s and Trotsky\\'s supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, Yevgeny Preobrazhensky and Leonid Serebryakov) supporting Trotsky.\\n\\nAt a meeting of his faction at the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921, Lenin\\'s faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky\\'s supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky\\'s place in the secretariat was taken by Vyacheslav Molotov. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents.\\n\\nRed Army troops attack\\n\\nKronstadt sailors in March 1921.\\n\\nDisappointed in the direction of the Bolshevik government, the rebels from Kronstadt—whom Leon Trotsky himself had praised earlier as \"adornment and pride of the revolution\"—demanded a series of reforms: reduction in Bolshevik power, newly elected soviet councils to include socialist and anarchist groups, economic freedom for peasants and workers, dissolution of the bureaucratic governmental organs created during the civil war, and the restoration of civil rights for the working class.[136]\\n\\nConvinced of the popularity of the reforms they were fighting for (which they partially tried to implement during the revolt), the Kronstadt seamen waited in vain for the support of the population in the rest of the country and rejected aid from emigrants. Although the council of officers advocated a more offensive strategy, the rebels maintained a passive attitude as they waited for the government to take the first step in negotiations. By contrast, the authorities took an uncompromising stance, presenting an ultimatum demanding unconditional surrender on March 5. Once this period expired, the Bolsheviks raided the island several times and suppressed the revolt on March 18 after killing several thousand people.\\n\\nKronstadt rebellion, which was the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.\\n\\n[137]\\n\\n[138]\\n\\nDwight Macdonald broke with Trotsky and left the Trotskyist\\n\\nSocialist Workers Party by noting the Kronstadt rebellion.\\n\\n[139]\\n\\nanarchist\\n\\nEmma Goldman. In her essay \"Trotsky Protests Too Much\", she states, \"I admit, the dictatorship under Stalin\\'s rule has become monstrous. That does not, however, lessen the guilt of Leon Trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which Kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes\".\\n\\n[140]\\n\\n[141]\\n\\n[142]\\n\\nAbbie Bakan, have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were \"counterrevolutionary\" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors\\' March rebellion.\\n\\n[143]\\n\\n[144]\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s contribution to the Russian Revolution[edit]\\n\\nPeople\\'s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, as the Guard of the\\n\\nOctober Revolution on 14 May 1923\\n\\nVladimir Cherniaev, a leading Russian historian, sums up Trotsky\\'s main contributions to the Russian Revolution:\\n\\nTrotsky bears a great deal of responsibility both for the victory of the Red Army in the civil war, and for the establishment of a one-party authoritarian state with its apparatus for ruthlessly suppressing dissent... He was an ideologist and practitioner of the Red Terror. He despised \"bourgeois democracy\"; he believed that spinelessness and soft-heartedness would destroy the revolution, and that the suppression of the propertied classes and political opponents would clear the historical arena for socialism. He was the initiator of concentration camps, compulsory \"labour camps\", and the militarization of labour, and the state takeover of trade unions. Trotsky was implicated in many practices which would become standard in the Stalin era, including summary executions.[145]\\n\\nHistorian Geoffrey Swain argues that:\\n\\nThe Bolsheviks triumphed in the Civil War because of Trotsky\\'s ability to work with military specialists, because of the style of work he introduced where widescale consultation was followed through by swift and determined action.[146]\\n\\nLenin said in 1921 that Trotsky was \"in love with organisation,\" but in working politics, \"he has not got a clue.\" Swain explains the paradox by arguing that Trotsky was not good at teamwork; he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist, not as a professional revolutionary like the others.[147]\\n\\nLenin\\'s illness (1922–1923)[edit]\\n\\nIn late 1921, Lenin\\'s health deteriorated and he was absent from Moscow for longer periods of time. He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee general secretary.[d] Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev[e] became part of the troika (triumvirate) formed by Stalin to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number-two man in the country and Lenin\\'s heir presumptive, would not succeed Lenin.\\n\\nThe rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the troika. Stalin\\'s power of patronage[f] in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted \\'normality,\\' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\\n\\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the troika nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).[148] In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\". Lenin was shocked and responded:[149]\\n\\nThrowing Trotsky overboard—surely you are hinting at that, it is impossible to interpret it otherwise—is the height of stupidity. If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that????\\n\\nLenin\\'s Testament.\\n\\nCouncil of People\\'s Commissars (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky \"categorically refused\". Lenin\\'s proposal has been interpreted by various scholars as evidence that he designated Trotsky as a successor as head of government.\\n\\n[150]\\n\\n[151]\\n\\n[152]\\n\\n[153]\\n\\n[154]\\n\\n1924\\n\\nIn late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy.[155] Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), further centralising state control. The alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade[g] but was hindered by Lenin\\'s progressing illness.\\n\\nIn January 1923, Lenin amended his Testament to suggest that Stalin should be removed as the party\\'s general secretary, while also mildly criticising Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders. The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin\\'s wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called \"Great-Russian nationalistic campaign\" at the XIIth Party Congress.\\n\\nAt the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin\\'s final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue.[156] Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the troika.[h] Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev\\'s backers.[157]\\n\\nThe delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a standing ovation. This upset the troika, already infuriated by Karl Radek\\'s article, \"Leon Trotsky – Organiser of Victory\"[i] published in Pravda on 14 March 1923. Stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin\\'s prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.\\n\\nThe power struggle in the Soviet Union which emerged during Lenin\\'s illness and eventual death would also determine the prospect of world revolution. In particular, the leadership of the German Communist party had requested that Moscow send Trotsky to Germany to direct the 1923 insurrection. However, this proposal was rejected by the Politburo which was controlled by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev who decided to send a commission of lower-ranking Russian Communist party members.[159]\\n\\nLeft opposition (1923–1924)[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nLeft Opposition\\n\\ncubist portrait by\\n\\nYury Annenkov – a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of\\n\\nTime\\n\\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"Workers\\' Truth\" and \"Workers\\' Group\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission, attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\\n\\nIn the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization. [...] The bureaucratization of the party apparatus has developed to unheard-of proportions by means of the method of secretarial selection. [...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.[160]\\n\\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent The Declaration of 46 to the Central Committee on 15 October, in which they wrote:\\n\\n[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into \"laymen\", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life. [...] free discussion within the party has virtually disappeared, party public opinion has been stifled. [...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.\\n\\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the troika and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev\\'s Pravda article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the troika tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group\\'s final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution\\'s ideas. The troika used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\"[161] and other sins.\\n\\nTrotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as The New Course in January 1924.[162] The illusion of a \"monolithic Bolshevik leadership\" was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of Pravda. The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16–18 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee\\'s position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the Left Opposition.[163] In 1924, in a series of conferences at Sverdlov University; Stalin cited several times, in a critical way \\'the Permanentists\\', as the followers of Trotsky \\'Permanent revolution\\'.\\n\\nForeign Secretary\\n\\nMarquess Curzon of Kedleston in 1923, in a parody of\\n\\nIlya Repin\\'s\\n\\nReply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks\\n\\nSince the troika controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin\\'s Secretariat and Pravda through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky\\'s position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-troika delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky\\'s position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\"[j] as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\".\\n\\nChristian Rakovsky,\\n\\nChairman of the\\n\\nUkraine Sovnarkom,\\n\\nBoris Souvarine of the\\n\\nFrench Communist Party and the Central Committee of the\\n\\nPolish Communist Party which was led by prominent theoreticians such as\\n\\nMaksymilian Horwitz,\\n\\nMaria Koszutska and\\n\\nAdolf Warski.\\n\\n[164]\\n\\nAfter Lenin\\'s death (1924)[edit]\\n\\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by troika partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the troika and its supporters. Trotsky\\'s control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing Mikhail Frunze, who was being groomed to take Trotsky\\'s place.\\n\\nAt the thirteenth Party Congress in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:[165]\\n\\nNone of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party. Clearly, the Party is always right... We can only be right with and by the Party, for history has provided no other way of being in the right. The English have a saying, \"My country, right or wrong\", whether it is in the right or in the wrong, it is my country. We have much better historical justification in saying whether it is right or wrong in certain individual concrete cases, it is my party... And if the Party adopts a decision which one or other of us thinks unjust, he will say, just or unjust, it is my party, and I shall support the consequences of the decision to the end.[166]\\n\\nAndrei Bubnov,\\n\\nKliment Voroshilov, Leon Trotsky,\\n\\nMikhail Kalinin, and\\n\\nMikhail Frunze attend the\\n\\nOctober Revolution parade in\\n\\nRed Square on 7 November 1924\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party \"regime\", began to crystallise. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the troika, but it also began formulating a program.\\n\\nEconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician Yevgeni Preobrazhensky came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation.[citation needed] That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the troika at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building \"socialism in one country\". These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\\n\\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin\\'s Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the troika, always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published Lessons of October,[167] an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\\n\\nIn it, he described Zinoviev\\'s and Kamenev\\'s opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the Literary Discussion, with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War.\\n\\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People\\'s Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky\\'s expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\\n\\nA year in the wilderness (1925)[edit]\\n\\nLeonid Serebryakov attend the\\n\\nCongress of Soviets of the Soviet Union in May 1925\\n\\n[77]\\n\\n[168]\\n\\n[169]\\n\\n[170]\\n\\nSome contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man.[171] Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (maintaining Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.[172]\\n\\nIn one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances of the controversy over Lenin\\'s Testament were described by American Marxist Max Eastman in his book Since Lenin Died (1925). Trotsky denied these statements made by Eastman in an article he wrote.[173]\\n\\nIn the meantime, the troika finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance Grigory Sokolnikov aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the XIV Party Congress in December 1925. With only the Leningrad Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed The New Opposition, were thoroughly defeated, while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.\\n\\nHouse of the Unions in March 1926\\n\\nUnited Opposition (1926–1927)[edit]\\n\\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky\\'s supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the United Opposition.\\n\\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the Chinese Revolution. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the GPU (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\\n\\n[174]\\n\\nPuyi, on 12 February 1912.\\n\\n[175]\\n\\nSun Yat-sen established the\\n\\nRepublic of China. In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people\\'s army and a national people\\'s party\"—the\\n\\nKuomintang. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people\\'s army. With the development of the nationalist army, a\\n\\nNorthern Expedition was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese\\n\\nCommunist Party to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.\\n\\n[176]\\n\\nKalinin and\\n\\nStalin bearing the coffin of\\n\\nFelix Dzerzhinsky on 22 July 1926. Trotsky can be seen over Kalinin\\'s left shoulder.\\n\\nTrotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition.[177] Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang Kai-shek\\'s right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927 by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.[178][179]\\n\\nDefeat and exile (1927–1928)[edit]\\n\\nOn the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Opposition held a street demonstration, and Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party shortly after.[180][181] Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat Adolph Joffe, in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to Alma Ata, Kazakhstan on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to Turkey in February 1929, accompanied by his wife Natalia Sedova and their eldest son, Lev.[182]\\n\\nFate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky\\'s exile (1929–1941)[edit]\\n\\nMy Life\\n\\nChristian Rakovsky, who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the Soviet Union and was exiled to\\n\\nYakutia in March 1933. Answering Trotsky\\'s request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist\\n\\nJean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist\\n\\nPierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author\\n\\nMaxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Constantinople.\\n\\n[183]\\n\\n[183]\\n\\nGestapo\").\\n\\n[184]\\n\\n[185]\\n\\nSergey Kirov, and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the Great Purge.\\n\\n[186]\\n\\nAlmost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union\\'s borders were executed in the Great Purges of 1936–1938, although Rakovsky survived until the Medvedev Forest massacre of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin\\'s orders, less than three months into the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Also among the Medvedev Forest victims was Trotsky\\'s sister/Kamenev\\'s first wife, Olga Kameneva.[15]\\n\\nExile (1929–1940)[edit]\\n\\nTurkey[edit]\\n\\nSoviet Union Consulate in\\n\\nIstanbul and then at a nearby hotel in the city. In April 1929, Trotsky, his wife and son were moved to the island of\\n\\nBüyükada by the Turkish authorities. On Büyükada, they were moved into a house called the Yanaros mansion.\\n\\n[187]\\n\\nMustafa Kemal Pasha. Trotsky was also at risk from the many former White Army officers who lived on Prinkipo, officers who had opposed the\\n\\nOctober Revolution and who had been defeated by Trotsky and the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky\\'s European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety.\\n\\n[188]\\n\\n[189]\\n\\nBüyükada in Turkey, as it appears today. Trotsky lived at the house from April 1929 until July 1933.\\n\\nIn 1931, Trotsky wrote a letter to a friend entitled \"What is Fascism\" in which he attempted to define fascism and asserted that the Communist International was wrong to describe the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera as \"fascist\" because it was not a mass movement arising from a base in the lower classes.[190]\\n\\n[191]\\n\\n[192]\\n\\nKingdom of Italy\\n\\n[193]\\n\\n[194]\\n\\n[195]\\n\\n[196]\\n\\nNazi Germany or\\n\\nJapan, as the Soviet Union government claimed. The alleged members of the anti-Stalin bloc were Zinovievites,\\n\\nrightists and Trotskyists who \"capitulated\" to Stalin. Kamenev and Zinoviev were also alleged members of the bloc. Trotsky wanted by no means that the alliance became a fusion, and he was afraid of the right gaining much power inside the bloc. Historian\\n\\nPierre Broué concluded that the bloc dissolved in early 1933, since some of its members like Zinoviev and Kamenev joined Stalin again, and because there were no letters in the Trotsky Harvard archive mentioning the bloc after 1932.\\n\\n[197]\\n\\nFrance[edit]\\n\\nÉdouard Daladier. Trotsky accepted the offer, but he was forbidden to live in\\n\\nParis and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French police.

After weighing his options, Trotsky applied to move to Norway.\\n\\nNorway[edit]\\n\\nTrygve Lie to enter the country, Trotsky and his wife became a guest of\\n\\nKonrad Knudsen at\\n\\nNorderhov, near\\n\\nHønefoss, and spent over a year living at Knudsen\\'s house, from 18 June 1935 to 2 September 1936. Trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby\\n\\nOslo Community Hospital, from 19 September 1935.\\n\\n[198]\\n\\nmass strikes in France in May and June 1936 with his articles, the\\n\\nJohan Nygaardsvold-led Norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about Trotsky\\'s actions. In the summer of 1936, Trotsky\\'s asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist\\n\\nNasjonal Samling, led by\\n\\nVidkun Quisling,\\n\\n[198]\\n\\n[199]\\n\\n[198]\\n\\nOn 14 August 1936, the Soviet Press Agency TASS announced the discovery of a \"Trotskyist–Zinovievist\" plot and the imminent start of the Moscow trials of the accused. Trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into Moscow\\'s accusations. The accused were sentenced to death, including Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, and executed on 25 August 1936. On 26 August 1936, eight policemen arrived at Knudsen\\'s house demanding that Trotsky sign new conditions for residing in Norway. These conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters, to give no interviews, and to have all his correspondence (incoming and outgoing) inspected by the police. Trotsky categorically refused the conditions, and Trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence.[199] The following day Trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities, with the police officially citing Trotsky as a \"witness\" to the fascist raid of 5 August 1936.[200]\\n\\nHurum,\\n\\n[201]\\n\\n[198]\\n\\n[198]\\n\\nNorwegian Labour Party Parliamentary leader,\\n\\nOlav Scheflo, were permitted to visit.\\n\\n[198]\\n\\n[198]\\n\\n[202]\\n\\nJonas Lie. When later living in Mexico, Trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at\\n\\nHurum, and accused the Norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the Moscow Trials and other show trials, saying:\\n\\nWhen I look back today on this period of internment, I must say that never, anywhere, in the course of my entire life—and I have lived through many things—was I persecuted with as much miserable cynicism as I was by the Norwegian \"Socialist\" government. For four months, these ministers, dripping with democratic hypocrisy, gripped me in a stranglehold to prevent me from protesting the greatest crime history may ever know.[198]\\n\\nMexico[edit]\\n\\nMexico City from April 1939 until his assassination in August 1940\\n\\nFrida Kahlo behind them.\\n\\nDuration: 3 minutes and 35 seconds.3:35\\n\\n[198]\\n\\nLázaro Cárdenas, welcomed Trotsky to Mexico and arranged for his special train\\n\\nTampico.\\n\\n[203]\\n\\nCoyoacán area of Mexico City at\\n\\nLa Casa Azul (The Blue House), the home of the painter\\n\\nDiego Rivera and Rivera\\'s wife and fellow painter,\\n\\nFrida Kahlo, with whom Trotsky had an affair.\\n\\n[204]\\n\\n[205]\\n\\nSelf-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky\\n\\n[206]\\n\\n[205]\\n\\nJames Cannon and\\n\\nFelix Morrow with a bust of Trotsky\\n\\nHistory of the Russian Revolution\\n\\nThe Revolution Betrayed\\n\\nStalinism.

This organization was short-lived and ended before 1940.\\n\\nMoscow show trials[edit]\\n\\nIn August 1936, the first Moscow show trial of the so-called \"Trotskyite–Zinovievite Terrorist Center\" was staged in front of an international audience. During the trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other accused, most of them prominent Old Bolsheviks, confessed to having plotted with Trotsky to kill Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership. The court found every defendant guilty,\\nin absentia, including Trotsky, sentencing them to death. The second show trial of Karl Radek, Grigori Sokolnikov, Yuri Pyatakov, and 14 others, took place in January 1937, during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to Trotsky. The findings were published in the book \"Not Guilty\".[210]\\n\\nThe Moscow trials are perpetuated under the banner of socialism. We will not concede this banner to the masters of falsehood!

Whoever seeks physical comfort and spiritual calm let him step aside. In time of reaction it is more convenient to lean on the bureaucracy than on the truth. But all those for whom the word \\'Socialism\\' is not a hollow sound but the content of their moral life—forward! Neither threats nor persecutions nor violations can stop us! Be it even over our bleaching bones the future will triumph! We will blaze the trail for it. It will conquer!

In mid-1933, after the Nazi takeover in Germany and the Comintern\\'s response to it, he changed his mind. He said:[213]\\n\\nAn organization which was not roused by the thunder of fascism and which submits docilely to such outrageous acts of the bureaucracy demonstrates thereby that it is dead and that nothing can ever revive it... In all our subsequent work it is necessary to take as our point of departure the historical collapse of the official Communist International.[214]\\n\\nIn 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International, which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the Stalinist Comintern.\\n\\nThe Dies Committee[edit]\\n\\nHarry DeBoer (left) in Mexico, shortly before his assassination, 1940\\n\\nTowards the end of 1939, Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Representative Martin Dies Jr., chairman of the committee, demanded the suppression of the American Communist Party. Trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the NKVD\\'s activities against him and his followers.\\n\\nHe made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[215]\\n\\nFinal months[edit]\\n\\nAfter quarreling with Diego Rivera, Trotsky moved to his final residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939.[216] On 27 February 1940, Trotsky wrote a document known as \"Trotsky\\'s Testament\", in which he expressed his final thoughts and feelings for posterity. He was suffering from high blood pressure, and feared that he would suffer a cerebral haemorrhage.[217] After forcefully denying Stalin\\'s accusations that he had betrayed the working class, he thanked his friends and above all his wife, Natalia Sedova, for their loyal support:\\n\\ndialectical materialist, and, consequently, an irreconcilable\\n\\natheist. My faith in the communist future of mankind is not less ardent, indeed it is firmer today, than it was in the days of my youth.\\n\\nNatasha has just come up to the window from the courtyard and opened it wider so that the air may enter more freely into my room.

According to Sudoplatov\\'s Special Tasks, the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks to carry out the murder; these three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD\\'s hitherto-established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.[218]\\n\\nNKVD agent\\n\\nIosif Grigulevich and Mexican painter\\n\\nDavid Alfaro Siqueiros.\\n\\n[219]\\n\\nRobert Sheldon Harte, disappeared with the attackers and was later found murdered; it is probable that he was an accomplice who granted them access to the villa.\\n\\n[220]\\n\\n[221]\\n\\n[222]\\n\\n[223]\\n\\nOn 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in his study by Spanish-born NKVD agent Ramón Mercader, who used an ice axe[224] as a weapon.[225][k] The operation was known within the NKVD as \"Operation Utka\" (Operation Duck).\\n\\nadze. The adze of the axe wounded Trotsky, fracturing his\\n\\nparietal bone and penetrating 7\\xa0cm (2.8\\xa0in) into his brain.\\n\\n[227]\\n\\n[228]\\n\\nexsanguination and shock.\\n\\n[229]\\n\\n[227]\\n\\nI laid my raincoat on the table in such a way as to be able to remove the ice axe which was in the pocket. I decided not to miss the wonderful opportunity that presented itself. The moment Trotsky began reading the article, he gave me my chance; I took out the ice axe from the raincoat, gripped it in my hand and, with my eyes closed, dealt him a terrible blow on the head.[228]\\n\\nSocialist Workers Party, Trotsky\\'s last words were \"I will not survive this attack.

Figes also described him as having \"too many characteristics that made it extraordinarily hard to work collectively with him\".\\n\\n[299]\\n\\nJoshua Rubenstein regarded Trotsky\\'s position among the Soviet elites as largely dependent on Lenin. Rubenstein also added that he had an image of an outsider within party circles as he had previously been an \"outspoken critic of Lenin\".\\n\\n[300]\\n\\nintellectuals but this was overshadowed by the huge apparatus which included the GPU and the party cadres who were at the disposal of Stalin.\\n\\n[301]\\n\\nPaul Dukes considered it a debatable notion that his personal \"sophistication\" as a political figure led to \"his defeat in the great struggle of 1923 and after\". He also reached the view that Trotsky did not share Stalin\\'s understanding of the party in which \"fewer than 10 percent of its members were fully\\n\\nliterate\" and this was in spite of the fact that Stalin \"was a man of narrower outlook in virtually every respect\".\\n\\n[302]\\n\\nBulgaria in 1923 and\\n\\nChina in 1927 had diminished the prospect of\\n\\nworld socialism and demoralised the Russian working class which in turn strengthened the growth of an internal, Soviet bureaucracy.\\n\\n[303]\\n\\nVadim Rogovin also remarked that Trotsky, in the 1930s, did not abandon hope for the spread of the revolution.

They characterized Lenin and Trotsky as \"fierce adversaries\" during the early years of the Russian socialist movement but described the duo as having reached a convergence and a substantial agreement in 1917 before colliding their efforts to achieve the October Revolution. They also highlighted the mutual appreciation and respect between Lenin and Trotsky with the former seeking to work closely with Trotsky on the Iskra newspaper, prior to their polemical disagreements, and Lenin acknowledging that his theory on permanent revolution \"happened to be right\" after 1917.[307]\\n\\n[308]\\n\\n[309]\\n\\nE.H. Carr,\\n\\nIsaac Deutscher,\\n\\nMoshe Lewin,\\n\\nRonald Suny and\\n\\nW. Bruce Lincoln across different generations. According to Le Blanc, these historians on balance had tilted \"toward the view that Lenin\\'s desired \"heir\" was collective responsibility in which Trotsky placed an important role and within which Stalin would be dramatically demoted (if not removed)\".\\n\\n[310]\\n\\nRoy Medvedev noted the close association of Trotsky and Lenin in the Soviet republic throughout the period of 1921–24. Medvedev mentioned a number of public commendations such as \"greetings in honour of comrades Lenin and Trotsky were announced at many\\n\\nrallies and meetings, and\\n\\nportraits of Lenin and Trotsky hung on the walls of many Soviet and party institutions\".\\n\\n[311]\\n\\nLenin and Trotsky (both photographed in 1920) were viewed as the leading figures in the \\n\\nfirst Soviet government\\n\\nChairman of the Council of People\\'s Commissars when the Bolsheviks formed a new government, after the\\n\\nOctober Revolution in 1917, and suggested Trotsky for the position. However, Trotsky refused the position and other Bolsheviks insisted that Lenin assume principal responsibility which thereafter resulted in Lenin eventually accepting the role of chairman.\\n\\n[312]\\n\\n[313]\\n\\n[314]\\n\\n[315]\\n\\n[316]\\n\\nnon-Bolshevik past against him.\\n\\n[317]\\n\\nMaxim Gorky recollected Lenin in the first version of his sketch,\\n\\n[318]\\n\\nNadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin was \"pleased with the definite manner\" of Trotsky\\'s theoretical comprehension of diverging Russian revolutionary movements during their first meeting in 1902. She similarly expressed this view in a personal note after Lenin\\'s death that her husband\\'s attitude towards Trotsky had \"not changed until his death\" since their initial meeting in London.\\n\\n[307]\\n\\nThe New Course\\n\\n[319]\\n\\nBoris Bazhanov, Lenin  \"in general leaned towards a\\n\\ncollegial leadership, with Trotsky in the first position\".\\n\\n[320]\\n\\nLenin\\'s succession[edit]\\n\\nComrade Trotsky, on the other hand, as his struggle against the C.C. on the question of the People\\'s Commissariat of Communications has already proved, is distinguished not only by outstanding ability. He is personally perhaps the most capable man in the present C.C., but he has displayed excessive self-assurance and shown excessive preoccupation with the purely administrative side of the work.\\n\\n—Lenin\\'s testament; 1923[321][322][323][324] Most historians consider the document to be an accurate reflection of Lenin\\'s views.[325][326]\\n\\n[327]\\n\\n[328]\\n\\n[329]\\n\\nforeign trade, party reform and the\\n\\nGeorgian affair.\\n\\n[330]\\n\\nRichard Pipes dismissed the view that Trotsky was Lenin\\'s successor due to his proposed and joint appointment as\\n\\ndeputy chairman with Kamenev in 1922. Pipes attributed this overstated claim to Trotsky\\'s supporters and explained that he had in fact been reprimanded by the party for \"categorically refusing\" the post.\\n\\n[331]\\n\\nauthority in 1922 and noted that Kamenev lacked any personal desire to become Chairman upon Lenin\\'s death.\\n\\n[332]\\n\\nFirst Deputy Chairman of the Council of the Sovnarkom\" as signifying that he was entrusted \"with the highest government post\" and he argued that this was also considerable given Lenin\\'s illness at the time. Rogovin also referenced a previous proposal by Lenin in 1917 to appoint Trotsky with another senior position as\\n\\nPeople\\'s Commissar of Internal Affairs.\\n\\n[333]\\n\\nSlavic studies scholar Derek Watson presumed that Trotsky would have been the first Vice-Chairman of an additional\\n\\nRSFSR body working alongside with the other deputies.\\n\\n[334]\\n\\nRykov to have been promoted above him as chairman after Lenin\\'s death in 1924.\\n\\n[335]\\n\\nMarian Kamil Dziewanowski also echoed these views and argued that had Trotsky accepted the post of Vice-Chairman then his prestige and power would have been strengthened as a counter-weight to Stalin\\'s growing influence. Dziewanowski expressed the view that Trotsky as Vice-Chairman would have been a natural successor to Lenin as\\n\\nChairman of the Soviet Union. However, his rejection of the position enabled Stalin to place Rykov as Lenin\\'s successor and serve as a key ally in the Politburo against Trotsky.\\n\\n[336]\\n\\npeasants holding\\n\\nbanners of Lenin (left),\\n\\nMarx (centre) and Trotsky (right) in early\\n\\nSoviet Russia.\\n\\nSimilarly, Soviet historian Victor Danilov believed that Lenin\\'s proposed appointment of Trotsky as deputy \"would have made him in effect Lenin\\'s successor\". Danilov also cited Politburo Secretary Bazhanov\\'s notes of a concluding speech delivered by Trotsky in 1923 to the wider party membership. Trotsky explained his decision to decline the proposed position of Lenin\\'s chief deputy due to concerns about his \"Jewish origins\" which could accentuate anti-semitic attitudes towards the Soviet Union.[337][338] Mccauley stated that Trotsky would \"almost certainly\" have become the successor had Lenin succumbed to his first stroke in 1922.[339] Deutscher noted that Zinoviev had been Lenin\\'s closest discipline rather than Trotsky between 1907 and 1917. However, Zinoviev\\'s opposition to the October revolution had strained his relations with Lenin.[340]\\n\\nWinston Churchill even argued that \"Lenin [had] indeed regarded Trotsky as his political heir\" and sought to protect him before his passing in 1924.\\n\\n[341]\\n\\n[342]\\n\\nTsiurupa. Although, he did reference a written document signed by Lenin in 1922 which assigned Trotsky and Kamenev different areas of focus as deputy chairmen.

The foundation \"International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum\" has been organized to raise funds to improve the museum further.\\n\\nShortly before his assassination, Trotsky agreed to sell the bulk of the papers he still had to Harvard University. After his assassination, his widow, Natalya Sedova collected his remaining papers and shipped them to Harvard, and in the years following, Harvard managed to collect additional papers that had been hidden from both Soviet and Nazi agents in Europe.[346] These papers now occupy 65 feet (20\\xa0m) of shelf space in Harvard\\'s Houghton Library.[347]\\n\\nTrotsky was never rehabilitated during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the de-Stalinization-era rehabilitation of most other Old Bolsheviks killed during the Great Purges. His son, Sergei Sedov, who died in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was Nikolai Bukharin. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky\\'s books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.\\n\\nTrotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the General Prosecutor\\'s Office of the Russian Federation (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center \"Memorial\").[348]\\n\\nWest German students holding a placard of Trotsky in 1968\\n\\nTrinidadian historian CLR James wrote, in the aftermath of Trotsky\\'s death, that he evoked strong feelings of enmity and fear from several political figures. According to James, this included Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill because \"these men knew his stature, the power of what he stood for, and were never lulled by the smallness of his forces\".[349]\\n\\nHistorian Harold Shukman assessed the conflicting perspectives on Trotsky\\'s legacy in the Soviet Union and the Western world. He also commented on the lack of a balanced view. Specifically, he stated:\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s legacy, unlike those of Stalin and Lenin, had long been submerged and obliterated as a topic of debate, and his place in Soviet history books had correspondingly diminished to one of no importance. For Western readers, however, Trotsky has always been one of the most enigmatic and powerful personalities of the Russian revolution, a Mephistophelian figure whose life ended in an appropriately dramatic way.[350]\\n\\nStalinist-run parties throughout the world, [which] were devoted to blackguarding Trotsky as an anti-Soviet saboteur, terrorist and fascist agent.

He viewed these recent trends in historiography as \"manifestations of the confluence of\\n\\nneo-Stalinist falsification and traditional Anglo-American\\n\\nanti-Communism\".\\n\\n[352]\\n\\nIn 2018, John Kelly wrote that \"almost 80 years after Leon Trotsky founded the Fourth International, there are now Trotskyite organisations in 57 countries, including most of Western Europe and Latin America\". However, he also argued that no Trotskyite group had ever led a revolution or built an enduring mass political party.[353]\\n\\nRobert Alexander made a similar observation in 1991 that Trotskyists had never assumed power in any nation but explained that the international movement did \"not enjoy the support of a well-established regime, as did the heirs of Stalinism\". Alexander also recognised that the \"persistence of the movement in a wide variety of countries\" and the instability of political events across most of the world means the \"possibility that a Trotskyist party might come to power in the foreseeable future cannot be totally ruled out\".[354]\\n\\nOn the other hand, British historian and socialist Christian Høgsbjerg believed that academic literature on Trotskyism had minimised its historical role in building wider social movements. Høgsbjerg stressed the key role of British Trotskyists in various movements such as the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign (1966-71), the Anti-Nazi League (1977-81), the Anti Poll Tax Federation (1989-91) and the Stop the War Coalition (2001).[355]\\n\\nHistorical reputation[edit]\\n\\n[356]\\n\\nrevolutionary\\n\\nliberator\".\\n\\n[357]\\n\\nhero of the\\n\\nrevolution.\\n\\n[358]\\n\\nPetrograd workers in which he drew \"vast crowds of\\n\\nworkers,\\n\\nsoldiers and\\n\\nsailors in Petrograd with his spellbinding\\n\\noratory in 1917\".\\n\\n[359]\\n\\nanti-Leninist.\\n\\n[360]\\n\\nbooks,\\n\\nmuseums and\\n\\nfilms.

Their battle-cry must be: The Permanent Revolution.\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism Georgy Plekhanov, that in \"backward\" countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with Alexander Parvus in late 1904–1905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky\\'s books 1905 and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"Results and Prospects.\" Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the Third World shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.[407]\\n\\nUnited front[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nUnited front\\n\\nTrotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the united front, a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.\\n\\nsocial fascists\". Historian Bertrand Patenaude believed that the Comintern policy following the \"\\n\\nGreat Break\" facilitated the rise of Hitler\\'s party.\\n\\n[408]\\n\\nHillel Ticktin argued that Trotsky\\'s political strategy and approach to fascism such as the emphasis on an organisational bloc between the\\n\\nGerman Communist Party and\\n\\nSocial-Democratic party during the interwar period would very likely have prevented Hitler\\n\\nfrom ascending to political power.\\n\\n[409]\\n\\nAfter he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British Socialist Workers Party in International Socialism, his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.[410]\\n\\nUneven and combined development[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nUneven and combined development\\n\\nThe concept of uneven and combined development derived from the political theories of Trotsky.[411] This concept was developed in combination with the related theory of permanent revolution to explain the historical context of Russia. He would later elaborate on this theory to explain the specific laws of uneven development in 1930 and the conditions for a possible revolutionary scenario.[412] According to biographer Ian Thatcher, this theory would be later generalised to \"the entire history of mankind\".[413]\\n\\nPolitical scientists Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan valued his theory as a \"signal contribution\" to the discipline of international relations. They argued his theory presented \"a specific understanding of capitalist development as \\'uneven\\', insofar as it systematically featured geographically divergent \\'advanced\\' and \\'backward\\' regions\" across the world economy.[414]\\n\\nLiterary criticism and socialist culture[edit]\\n\\nCubist, stylized depictions of Trotsky which have been attributed to\\n\\nYury Annenkov, 1921\\n\\nIn Literature and Revolution, Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution. Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work as the \"first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader\" and a catalyst for later, Marxist cultural and critical theories.[415] Trotsky\\'s writings on literature such as his 1923 survey which advocated tolerance, limited censorship and respect for literary tradition had strong appeal to the New York Intellectuals.[416]\\n\\nTrotsky presented a critique of contemporary literary movements such as Futurism and emphasised a need of cultural autonomy for the development of a socialist culture. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Trotsky recognised \"like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art\".[417] Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as \"temporary and transitional\" which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the pre-conditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints.[418]\\n\\nPolitical scientist Baruch Knei-Paz characterised his view on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner. Knei-Paz also noted key distinctions between Trotsky\\'s approach on cultural matters and Stalin\\'s policy in the 1930s.[418]\\n\\nIn popular culture[edit]\\n\\nThe comedic film, The Trotsky, centers on a protagonist named Leon Bronstein, played by Jay Baruchel, who believes himself to be the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky.[419]\\n\\nThe characters of Snowball and Emmanuel Goldstein in George Orwell\\'s novels, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four respectively, are based on Trotsky.[420][421]\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s final days and death was dramatized in the 1972 film The Assassination of Trotsky, directed by Joseph Losey and starring Richard Burton as Trotsky.[422][423]\\n\\nThe 8-episode biographical drama Trotsky debuted on the Russian Channel One in 2017, Netflix purchased the distribution rights to the series in 2018 and made it available on its platform.[424]\\n\\n1980s UK band The Redskins debut single was entitled \"Lev Bronstein\", released on the CNT record label in 1982.[425]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nAnti-Stalinist left\\n\\nFourth International\\n\\nForeign relations of the Soviet Union\\n\\nGroup of Democratic Centralism\\n\\nLabor army\\n\\nLeft Opposition\\n\\nLenin\\'s Testament\\n\\nLeon Trotsky bibliography\\n\\nList of Trotskyist internationals\\n\\nList of Trotskyist organizations by country\\n\\nPetrograd Soviet\\n\\nPrimitive socialist accumulation\\n\\nRussian Revolution of 1905\\n\\nScissors Crisis\\n\\nSocialist democracy\\n\\nTrotsky\\'s train, armoured train carriage which was used for logistical travel and oration speeches.\\n\\nUneven and combined development\\n\\nWorld socialism\\n\\nThe Assassination of Trotsky, 1972 film\\n\\nReds, 1981 film about the October Revolution\\n\\nVariations on the Death of Trotsky, 1991 play\\n\\nFrida, 2002 film\\n\\nThe Chosen, 2016 film\\n\\nTrotsky, 2017 TV series\\n\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n^ Trotsky was People\\'s Commissar for Military Affairs from 14 March 1918 and People\\'s Commissar for Naval Affairs from April 1918 before the offices were merged on 12 November 1923.\\n\\n^ Russian: Лев \"Лейба\" Давидович Бронштейн, tr.

He was replaced by Elena Stasova, and in November 1919 by Nikolai Krestinsky.\\n\\nAfter Krestinsky\\'s ouster in March 1921, Vyacheslav Molotov became the senior secretary, but he lacked Krestinsky\\'s authority, since he was not a full Politburo member. Stalin took over the position as senior secretary, which was formalized at the XIth Party Congress in April 1922, with Molotov becoming second secretary.\\n\\n^ It is not clear why Kamenev, a mild-mannered man with few leadership ambitions and who was the brother-in-law of Trotsky, sided with Zinoviev and Stalin against Trotsky in 1922. Trotsky later speculated that it may have been due to Kamenev\\'s love of comfort, which Trotsky found \"repelled me.\" He expressed his feelings to Kamenev in late 1920 or early 1921:Our relations with Kamenev, which were very good in the first period after the insurrection, began to become more distant from that day.\\n\\n^ The Central Committee\\'s Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath, as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones. The change was prompted by the need to allocate manpower quickly during the Civil War as well as by the transformation of the party from a small group of revolutionaries into the country\\'s ruling party, with a corresponding increase in membership. New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.[citation needed]\\n\\nTo prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee. This put enormous power in the general secretary\\'s hands.\\n\\n^ Lenin\\'s letter to Stalin dictated on 15 December 1922: \"I am sure Trotsky will uphold my views as well as I.\" Faced with a united opposition by Lenin and Trotsky, the Central Committee reversed its previous decision and adopted the Lenin-Trotsky proposal.\\n\\n^ Trotsky explained in Chapter 12 of his unfinished book Stalin that he refused to deliver the report because \"it seemed to me equivalent to announcing my candidacy for the role of Lenin\\'s successor at a time when Lenin was fighting a grave illness.\\n\\n^ Radek wrote:[158]The need of the hour was for a man who would incarnate the call to struggle, a man who, subordinating himself completely to the requirements of the struggle, would become the ringing summons to arms, the will which exacts from all unconditional submission to a great, sacrificial necessity. Only a man with Trotsky\\'s capacity for work, only a man so unsparing of himself as Trotsky, only a man who knew how to speak to the soldiers as Trotsky did—only such a man could have become the standard bearer of the armed toilers. He was all things rolled into one.\\n\\n^ The term \"Trotskyism\" was first coined by the Russian liberal politician Pavel Milyukov, the first foreign minister in the Provisional Government who, in April 1917, was forced to demand that the British government release Trotsky.\\n\\n^ The murder weapon was an ice axe (and not an ice pick—an awl-like bartender\\'s tool); this misnomer has been explained as being occasioned by the assassin\\'s use of the French-language term picolet—meaning the winter-mountaineering tool which resembles the pickaxes used in mining and other excavations, and by the multiple languages spoken by those involved in reporting the details; many history and reference books have confused the two tools.[226]\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ Cliff, Tony (2004) [1976]. \"Lenin Rearms the Party\".

He was later ruler of the puppet state of\\n\\nManchukuo under the\\n\\nEmpire of Japan from 1934 to 1945. He became emperor at the age of two in 1908, but was forced to abdicate in 1912 as a result of\\n\\nXinhai Revolution at the age of six. During his first reign, he was known as the\\n\\nera name meaning \"proclamation of unity\".\\n\\nrestored to the Qing throne by the loyalist general\\n\\nZhang Xun from 1 July to 12 July 1917. He was first wed to\\n\\nEmpress Wanrong in 1922 in an arranged marriage. In 1924, he was expelled from the\\n\\nForbidden City and found refuge in\\n\\nTianjin, where he began to court both\\n\\nthe warlords fighting for control over parts of the weak\\n\\nRepublic of China and the Japanese who had long desired control of China. The\\n\\nJapanese invasion of Manchuria in 1932 resulted in the puppet state of Manchukuo being established by Japan, who chose Puyi to become its chief executive, using the era name \"Datong\".\\n\\nSecond Sino-Japanese War in 1945. This third stint as emperor saw him as a puppet of Japan; he signed most edicts the Japanese gave him. During this period, he largely resided in the\\n\\nSalt Tax Palace, where he regularly ordered his servants beaten. His first wife\\'s\\n\\nopium addiction consumed her during these years, and they were generally distant. He took on numerous\\n\\nconcubines, as well as male lovers. With the\\n\\nsurrender of Japan in 1945, Puyi fled the capital and was eventually captured by the Soviets who had\\n\\noccupied the country; he was extradited to the\\n\\nPeople\\'s Republic of China in 1950. After his capture, he never saw his first wife again; she died of starvation in a Chinese prison in 1946.\\n\\nPuyi was a defendant at the Tokyo Trials and was later imprisoned and re-educated as a war criminal for 10\\xa0years. After his release in 1959, he wrote his memoirs (with the help of a ghost writer) and became a titular member of the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference and the National People\\'s Congress of the People\\'s Republic of China. His time in prison greatly changed him, and he expressed deep regret for his actions while he was emperor. He died in 1967 and was ultimately buried near the Western Qing tombs in a commercial cemetery.\\n\\nEmperor of China (1908–1912)[edit]\\n\\nEmpress Dowager Cixi,\\n\\n[1]\\n\\nGuangxu Emperor, Puyi\\'s half-uncle, died childless on 14\\xa0November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor, Puyi\\'s introduction to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13\\xa0November, without any advance notice, a procession of\\n\\neunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the\\n\\nNorthern Mansion to inform\\n\\nPrince Chun that they were taking away his two-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor.\\n\\n[2]\\n\\n[3]\\n\\n[4]\\n\\npalanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City.\\n\\n[4]\\n\\nWang Lianshou, Puyi\\'s\\n\\nwet nurse, was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him.\\n\\n[4]\\n\\n[5]\\n\\nI still have a dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that I burst out into loud howls at the sight and started to tremble uncontrollably. Cixi told someone to give me some sweets, but I threw them on the floor and yelled \"I want nanny, I want nanny\", to her great displeasure. \"What a naughty child\", she said. \"Take him away to play.\"[5]\\n\\nCixi died on 15\\xa0November, less than two days after the meeting. Puyi\\'s father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent. During Puyi\\'s coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2\\xa0December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father.[5] Puyi was frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music, and started crying. His father could do nothing except quietly comfort him: \"Don\\'t cry, it\\'ll be over soon.\"[6] Puyi wrote in his autobiography:\\n\\nTwo days after I entered the palace, Cixi died and on 2 December the \"Great Enthronement Ceremony\" took place, a ceremony that I ruined with my tears.[7][failed verification – see discussion]\\n\\nPuyi did not see his biological mother, Princess Consort Chun, for the next seven years. He developed a special bond with Wang and credited her as the only person who could control him. She was sent away when he was eight years old. After Puyi married, he would occasionally bring her to the Forbidden City, and later Manchukuo, to visit him. After his special government pardon in 1959, she visited her adopted son and only then did he learn of her personal sacrifices to be his nurse.[8]\\n\\nGrowing up with scarcely any memory of a time when he was not indulged and revered, Puyi quickly became spoiled. The adults in his life, except for Wang, were all strangers, remote, distant, and unable to discipline him.[9] Wherever he went, grown men would kneel down in a ritual kowtow, averting their eyes until he passed. Soon he discovered the absolute power he wielded over the eunuchs, and he frequently had them beaten for small transgressions.[3] As an emperor, Puyi\\'s every whim was catered to while no one ever said no to him, making him into a sadistic boy who loved to have his eunuchs flogged.[10] The Anglo-French journalist Edward Behr wrote about Puyi\\'s power as emperor of China, which allowed him to fire his air-gun at anyone he liked:\\n\\nThe Emperor was Divine. He could not be remonstrated with, or punished. He could only be deferentially advised against ill-treating innocent eunuchs, and if he chose to fire air-gun pellets at them, that was his prerogative.\\n\\n—\\u200a\\n\\n[10]\\n\\nPuyi later said, \"Flogging eunuchs was part of my daily routine. My cruelty and love of wielding power were already too firmly set for persuasion to have any effect on me.\"[9]\\n\\nWang was the only person capable of controlling Puyi; once, Puyi decided to \"reward\" a eunuch for a well-done puppet show by having a cake baked for him with iron filings in it, saying, \"I want to see what he looks like when he eats it\".[9] With much difficulty, Wang talked Puyi out of this plan.[9]\\n\\nEvery day, Puyi had to visit five former imperial concubines, called his \"mothers\", to report on his progress. He hated his \"mothers\", not least because they prevented him from seeing his real mother until he was 13.[11] Their leader was the autocratic Empress Dowager Longyu, who successfully conspired to have Puyi\\'s beloved wet nurse Wang expelled from the Forbidden City when he was 8 on the grounds that Puyi was too old to be breast-fed.[12] Puyi especially hated Longyu for that.[12] Puyi later wrote, \"Although I had many mothers, I never knew any motherly love.\"[12] Empress dowager Longyu ruled with paramount authority over the Qing imperial court, and though she was not the de jure \"regent\", she was the de facto ruler of the Qing empire.\\n\\nConfucian education, being taught the various\\n\\nChinese classics and nothing else.\\n\\n[13]\\n\\n[13]\\n\\n[14]\\n\\n[14]\\n\\nPujie never heard his parents refer to Puyi as \"your elder brother\" but only as \"The Emperor\".\\n\\n[14]\\n\\n[14]\\n\\n[7]\\n\\nfailed verification –\\n\\nsee discussion\\n\\nEunuchs and the Household Department[edit]\\n\\nSeparated from his family, Puyi lived his childhood in a regime of virtual seclusion in the Forbidden City, surrounded by guards, eunuchs and other servants who treated him like a god. The emperor\\'s upbringing was a mixture of pampering and mistreatment, as he was required to follow all the rules of rigid Chinese imperial protocol and was unable to behave like a normal child.[15][failed verification – see discussion]\\n\\nThe eunuchs were virtual slaves who did all the work in the Forbidden City, such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining guests, and the bureaucratic work needed to govern a vast empire. They also served as the emperor\\'s advisers.[16] The Forbidden City was full of treasures that the eunuchs constantly stole and sold on the black market.[17] The business of government and of providing for the emperor created further opportunities for corruption, in which virtually all the eunuchs engaged.[17]\\n\\nPuyi never had any privacy and had all his needs attended to at all times, having eunuchs open doors for him, dress him, wash him, and even blow air into his soup to cool it.[18] At his meals, Puyi was always presented with a huge buffet containing every conceivable dish, the vast majority of which he did not eat, and every day he wore new clothing, as Chinese emperors never reused their clothing.[19]\\n\\n[20]\\n\\nZheng Xiaoxu as minister of Household Department, and Zheng Xiaoxu hired\\n\\nTong Jixu, a former Air Force officer from the\\n\\nBeiyang Army, as his chief of staff to help with the reforms. But on 27\\xa0June 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness, just at the moment when the emperor had ordered to carry out the inventory of one of the imperial warehouses. Puyi suspected it was arson to cover theft. The emperor overheard conversations among the eunuchs that made him fear for his life. In response, a month after the fire, he evicted the eunuchs from the palace with the support of the Beiyang Army.\\n\\n[21]\\n\\nFeng Yuxiang.\\n\\n[22]\\n\\nAbdication[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nImperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor\\n\\nthe army garrison in Wuhan mutinied, sparking a widespread revolt in the Yangtze river valley and beyond, demanding the overthrow of the Qing dynasty that had ruled China since 1644.\\n\\n[23]\\n\\nYuan Shikai was dispatched by the court to crush the revolution, but was unable to, as by 1911 public opinion had turned decisively against the Qing, and many Chinese had no wish to fight for a dynasty that was seen as having lost the\\n\\nmandate of heaven.\\n\\n[23]\\n\\nPrince Chun, served as a regent until 6 December, when\\n\\nEmpress Dowager Longyu took over following the\\n\\nXinhai Revolution.\\n\\n[24]\\n\\nEmpress Dowager Longyu endorsed the \"Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor\" on 12 February 1912, under a deal brokered by Yuan, now Prime Minister, with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China.[25] Puyi recalled in his autobiography the meeting between Longyu and Yuan:\\n\\nThe Dowager Empress was sitting on a kang [platform] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief as a fat old man [Yuan] knelt before her on a red cushion, tears streaming down his face. I was sitting to the right of the widow and wondering why both adults were crying. There was no one in the room other than the three of us and everything was very quiet; the fat man snorted as he spoke and I couldn\\'t understand what he was saying... This was the time when Yuan directly raised the question of abdication.[26]\\n\\nLife in the Forbidden City (1912–1924)[edit]\\n\\nArticles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication\", signed with the new\\n\\nRepublic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the\\n\\nprotocol attached to a foreign monarch. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the\\n\\nSummer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver\\n\\ntaels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic, and continued to believe that he was still emperor for some time.\\n\\n[27]\\n\\n[28]\\n\\n[29]\\n\\n[28]\\n\\n[28]\\n\\n[29]\\n\\nproclaimed himself as emperor, and he was planning to marry his daughter to Puyi, but had to abdicate in the face of popular opposition.\\n\\n[30]\\n\\nBrief restoration (1917)[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nManchu Restoration\\n\\nZhang Xun restored Puyi to the throne from 1 July to 12 July.\\n\\n[31]\\n\\nqueues to display loyalty to the emperor. However, then-Premier of the Republic of China\\n\\nDuan Qirui ordered a\\n\\nCaudron Type D plane, piloted by Pan Shizhong (潘世忠) with bombardier Du Yuyuan (杜裕源) from\\n\\nNanyuan airfield, to drop three bombs over the Forbidden City as a show of force against Zhang Xun, causing the death of a eunuch, but otherwise inflicting minor damage.\\n\\n[32]\\n\\n[33]\\n\\nChinese Air Force, and the restoration failed due to extensive opposition across China.\\n\\n[34]\\n\\nRelationship with Reginald Johnston[edit]\\n\\nReginald Johnston arrived in the Forbidden City to serve as Puyi\\'s tutor.\\n\\n[35]\\n\\nXu Shichang believed the monarchy would eventually be restored, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi \"subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English\".\\n\\n[36]\\n\\nAlice in Wonderland\\n\\nFour Great Books\" of\\n\\nConfucianism; the\\n\\nAnalects\\n\\nMencius\\n\\nGreat Learning\\n\\nDoctrine of the Mean\\n\\n[36]\\n\\n[37]\\n\\n[37]\\n\\n[35]\\n\\nReginald Johnston, who became Puyi\\'s tutor in 1919\\n\\n[35]\\n\\nWanrong as \"Elizabeth\" as Puyi began to speak \"\\n\\nChinglish\", a mixture of\\n\\nMandarin and English that became his preferred mode of speech.\\n\\n[38]\\n\\n[39]\\n\\nMay 4th movement as thousands of Chinese university students protested against the decision by the great powers at the\\n\\nParis peace conference to award the former\\n\\nGerman concessions in\\n\\nShandong together with the former German colony of\\n\\nQingdao to Japan.\\n\\n[40]\\n\\n[40]\\n\\nHe appears to be physically robust and well developed for his age. He is a very \"human\" boy, with liveliness, intelligence and an enthusiastic sense of humour. Furthermore, he has excellent manners and is totally free from arrogance […] Although the emperor does not seem to have been spoiled yet, from the nonsense and futility that surrounds him, I am afraid there is no hope that he will emerge unscathed from the moral dangers through of the next few years of his life (very critical years necessarily for a boy in his early adolescence), unless he can be removed from the influence of the hordes of eunuchs and other useless officials who are now almost his only companions. I am inclined to think that the best course of action to take in the interest of the boy himself would be to remove him from the harmful atmosphere of the \"Forbidden City\" and send him to the Summer Palace. There it would be possible for him to live a much less artificial and happier life than he can under the present conditions...[41]\\n\\nZhang Garden with Wanrong and Johnston\\n\\nManchu; he only knew a single word in the language,\\n\\n[42]\\n\\n[43]\\n\\n[44]\\n\\n[45]\\n\\nSyed Mohammad Ali, Puyi spoke Mandarin when interviewed, but Ali believed he could understand English.\\n\\n[46]\\n\\nHarold Lloyd films, that he had a film projector installed in the Forbidden City despite the opposition of the eunuchs.\\n\\n[47]\\n\\nmyopia, as he was extremely near-sighted, and after much argument with Prince Chun, who thought it was undignified for an emperor, finally prevailed.\\n\\n[48]\\n\\n[49]\\n\\nHu Shih, visit the Forbidden City to teach Puyi about recent developments in\\n\\nChinese literature.\\n\\n[50]\\n\\nUniversity of Oxford, Johnston\\'s\\n\\n[51]\\n\\n[52]\\n\\n[53]\\n\\nMarriage[edit]\\n\\nGobulo Wanrong, Puyi\\'s wife and Empress of China\\n\\nWenxiu\\n\\n[54]\\n\\nErdet Wenxiu as his wife, but was told that she was acceptable only as a\\n\\nconcubine, so he would have to choose again.\\n\\n[55]\\n\\n[56]\\n\\nGobulo Wanrong, the daughter of one of Manchuria\\'s richest aristocrats, who had been educated in English by American missionaries in Tianjin, who was considered to be an acceptable empress by the Dowager Consorts.\\n\\n[57]\\n\\n[57]\\n\\n[57]\\n\\n[58]\\n\\n[59]\\n\\n[60]\\n\\n[59]\\n\\nTwilight in the Forbidden City\\n\\n[61]\\n\\n[62]\\n\\n[63]\\n\\nkowtowed to him six times in her living quarters to symbolize her submission to her husband as the decree of their marriage was read out.\\n\\n[63]\\n\\nWanrong wore a mask in accordance with Chinese tradition and Puyi, who knew nothing of women, remembered: \"I hardly thought about marriage and family. It was only when the Empress came into my field of vision with a crimson satin cloth embroidered with a dragon and a phoenix over her head that I felt at all curious about what she looked like.\"[64] After the wedding was complete, Puyi, Wanrong, and his secondary consort Wenxiu (whom he married the same night) went to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, where everything was red – the colour of love and sex in China – and where emperors had traditionally consummated their marriages.[64] Puyi, who was sexually inexperienced and timid, fled from the bridal chamber, leaving his wives to sleep in the Dragon Bed by themselves.[65] Of Puyi\\'s failure to consummate his marriage on his wedding night, Behr wrote:\\n\\nIt was perhaps too much to expect an adolescent, permanently surrounded by eunuchs, to show the sexual maturity of a normal seventeen-year-old. Neither the Dowager consorts nor Johnston himself had given him any advice on sexual matters – this sort of thing simply was not done, where emperors were concerned: it would have been an appalling breach of protocol. But the fact remains that a totally inexperienced, over-sheltered adolescent, if normal, could hardly have failed to be aroused by Wan Jung\\'s [Wanrong\\'s] unusual, sensual beauty. The inference is, of course, that Pu Yi was either impotent, extraordinarily immature sexually, or already aware of his homosexual tendencies.[65]\\n\\nWanrong\\'s younger brother Rong Qi remembered how Puyi and Wanrong, both teenagers, loved to race their bicycles through the Forbidden City, forcing eunuchs to get out of the way, and told Behr in an interview: \"There was a lot of laughter, she and Puyi seemed to get on well, they were like kids together.\"[66] In 1986, Behr interviewed one of Puyi\\'s two surviving eunuchs, an 85-year-old who was reluctant to answer the questions asked of him, but finally said of Puyi\\'s relationship with Wanrong: \"The Emperor would come over to the nuptial apartments once every three months and spend the night there ... He left early in the morning on the following day and for the rest of that day he would invariably be in a very filthy temper indeed.\"[67] A eunuch who served in the Forbidden City as Wanrong\\'s personal servant later wrote in his memoir that there was a rumour among the eunuchs that Puyi was gay, noting a strange situation where he was asked by Puyi to stand inside Wanrong\\'s room while Puyi groped her.[68] Another eunuch claimed that Puyi preferred the \"land-way\" of the eunuchs to the \"water-way\" of the Empress,  implying he was gay.[69]\\n\\nPuyi rarely left the Forbidden City, knew nothing of the lives of ordinary Chinese people, and was somewhat misled by Johnston, who told him that the vast majority of the Chinese wanted a Qing restoration.[51] Johnston, a Sinophile scholar and a romantic conservative with an instinctive preference for monarchies, believed that China needed a benevolent autocrat to guide the country forward.[51] He was enough of a traditionalist to respect that all major events in the Forbidden City were determined by the court astrologers.[70] Johnston disparaged the superficially Westernised Chinese republican elite who dressed in top hats, frock coats, and business suits as not authentically Chinese, and praised to Puyi the Confucian scholars with their traditional robes as the ones who were authentically Chinese.[51]\\n\\nAs part of an effort to crack down on corruption by the eunuchs, inspired by Johnston, Puyi ordered an inventory of the Forbidden City\\'s treasures. The Hall of Established Happiness was burned on the night of 26 June 1923, as the eunuchs tried to cover up the extent of their theft.[71] Johnston reported that the next day, he \"found the Emperor and Empress standing on a heap of charred wood, sadly contemplating the spectacle\".[72] The treasures reported lost in the fire included 2,685\\xa0golden statues of Buddha, 1,675\\xa0golden altar ornaments, 435\\xa0porcelain antiques, and 31\\xa0boxes of sable furs, though it is likely that most if not all of these had been sold on the black market before the fire.[73]\\n\\n[74]\\n\\n[75]\\n\\n[75]\\n\\nGreat Kantō earthquake on 1\\xa0September 1923 destroyed the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama, Puyi donated jade antiques worth some £33,000 to pay for disaster relief, which led a delegation of Japanese diplomats to visit the Forbidden City to express their thanks.\\n\\n[76]\\n\\n[77]\\n\\nExpulsion from the Forbidden City (1924)[edit]\\n\\na coup led by the warlord\\n\\nFeng Yuxiang took control of Beijing.

One contemporary commentator, Wen Yuan-ning, quipped that Puyi had now achieved the dubious distinction of having been \"made emperor three times without knowing why and apparently without relishing it.\"[122]\\n\\nA New York Times article from 1933 declared: \"There is probably no more democratic or friendlier ruler in the world than Henry Pu-yi, former Emperor of China and now Chief Executive of the new State of Manchukuo.\"[123]\\n\\nChangchun.\\n\\n[124]\\n\\nJapanese propaganda depicted the birth of Manchukuo as a triumph of\\n\\nPan-Asianism, with the \"\\n\\nfive races\" of Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols coming together, which marked nothing less than the birth of a new civilization and a turning point in world history.\\n\\n[125]\\n\\n[125]\\n\\nOn 8 March 1932, Puyi made his ceremonial entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng, who was beaming with joy, Amakasu, whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable.[126]\\nPuyi also noted he was \"too preoccupied with my hopes and hates\" to realize the \"cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me\".[127] Puyi\\'s friend, the British journalist Woodhead wrote, \"outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime\", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorised by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin \"lawless\\xa0... even its main street unsafe after dark\".[128] In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi said he planned to govern Manchukuo \"in the Confucian spirit\" and that he was \"perfectly happy\" with his new position.[129]\\n\\nLytton Commission arrived in Manchuria to begin its investigation of whether Japan had committed aggression.\\n\\n[125]\\n\\nVictor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, and recalled thinking that he desperately wanted to ask him for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that \"the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free\".\\n\\n[130]\\n\\n[131]\\n\\nWellington Koo, who was attached to the commission as its Chinese assessor, received a secret message saying \"...\\xa0a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me\".\\n\\n[132]\\n\\n[133]\\n\\n[133]\\n\\nMa Zhanshan, to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defence Minister.\\n\\n[134]\\n\\n[134]\\n\\nHirohito wanted to see if Puyi was reliable before giving him an imperial title, and it was not until October 1933 that General Doihara told him he was to be an emperor again, causing Puyi to go, in his own words, \"wild with joy\", though he was disappointed that he was not given back his old title of \"Great Qing Emperor\".\\n\\n[135]\\n\\n[136]\\n\\n[137]\\n\\n[138]\\n\\nAmleto Vespa remembered that General Kenji Doihara told him Manchuria was going to have to pay for its own exploitation.\\n\\n[139]\\n\\nSimon Kaspé, a French Jewish pianist visiting his father in Manchukuo, who owned a hotel in Harbin, was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by an anti-Semitic gang from the\\n\\nRussian Fascists.

Eckert wrote that the differences in power could be seen in that the Kwantung Army had a \"massive\" headquarters in downtown Xinjing while Puyi had to live in the \"small and shabby\" Salt Tax Palace close to the main railroad station in a part of Xinjing with numerous small factories, warehouses, and slaughterhouses, the chief prison, and the red-light district.\\n\\n[155]\\n\\nBehr commented that Puyi knew from his talks in Tianjin with General Kenji Doihara and General Seishirō Itagaki that he was dealing with \"ruthless men and that this might be the regime to expect\".[156] Puyi later recalled that: \"I had put my head in the tiger\\'s mouth\" by going to Manchuria in 1931.[156]\\n\\nChū Kudō\\n\\nFrom 1935 to 1945, Kwantung Army senior staff officer Yoshioka Yasunori (吉岡安則)[157] was assigned to Puyi as Attaché to the Imperial Household in Manchukuo. He acted as a spy for the Japanese government, controlling Puyi through fear, intimidation, and direct orders.[158] There were many attempts on Puyi\\'s life during this period, including a 1937 stabbing by a palace servant.[80]\\n\\nIn 1935, Puyi visited Japan.[159] The Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Xinjing, Kenjiro Hayashide, served as Puyi\\'s interpreter during this trip, and later wrote what Behr called a very absurd book, The Epochal Journey to Japan, chronicling this visit, where he managed to present every banal statement made by Puyi as profound wisdom, and claimed that he wrote an average of two poems per day on his trip to Japan, despite being busy with attending all sorts of official functions.[160] Hayashide had also written a booklet promoting the trip in Japan, which claimed that Puyi was a great reader who was \"hardly ever seen without a book in his hand\", a skilled calligrapher, a talented painter, and an excellent horseman and archer, able to shoot arrows while riding, just like his Qing ancestors.[161] Hirohito took this claim that Puyi was a hippophile seriously, and presented him with a gift of a horse for him to review the Imperial Japanese Army with; in fact, Puyi was a hippophobe who adamantly refused to get on the horse, forcing the Japanese to hurriedly bring out a carriage for the two emperors to review the troops.[162]\\n\\n[163]\\n\\n[164]\\n\\nKaspé case in Harbin in March–June 1936, the Japanese prosecutor argued in favour of the six defendants, calling them \"Russian patriots who raised the flag against a world danger – communism\".\\n\\n[140]\\n\\nRussian Fascist Party called the six men \"martyrs for Holy Russia\", and presented to Puyi a petition with thousands of signatures asking him to pardon the six men.\\n\\n[140]\\n\\n[165]\\n\\n[140]\\n\\n[162]\\n\\nKenkichi Ueda visited Puyi to tell him the matter was resolved as Ling had already been convicted by a Japanese court-martial of \"plotting rebellion\" and had been executed by beheading, which led Puyi to cancel the marriage between his sister and Ling\\'s son.\\n\\n[166]\\n\\ntraditional Chinese law and religion\\n\\n[167]\\n\\nConfucianism and\\n\\nBuddhism), but this was disallowed by the Japanese.

If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party\".[246] Puyi was to be subjected to \"remodelling\" to make him into a Communist.[247]\\n\\nIn 1950, the Soviets loaded Puyi and the rest of the Manchukuo and Japanese prisoners onto a train that took them to China with Puyi convinced he would be executed when he arrived.[248] Puyi was surprised at the kindness of his Chinese guards, who told him this was the beginning of a new life for him.[249] In attempt to ingratiate himself, Puyi for the first time in his life addressed commoners with the informal word for \"you\" instead of formal word for \"you\".[249]\\n\\nHarbin, Puyi spent ten years in the\\n\\nFushun War Criminals Prison in Liaoning until he was declared reformed. The prisoners at Fushun were senior Japanese, Manchukuo and Kuomintang officials and officers.\\n\\n[250]\\n\\n[251]\\n\\n[252]\\n\\n[226]\\n\\nMuch of Puyi\\'s \"remodelling\" consisted of attending \"Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought discussion groups\" where the prisoners would discuss their lives before being imprisoned.[253] When Puyi protested to Jin that it had been impossible to resist Japan and there was nothing he could have done, Jin confronted him with people who had fought in the resistance and had been tortured, and asked him why ordinary people in Manchukuo resisted while an emperor did nothing.[254] Puyi had to attend lectures where a former Japanese civil servant spoke about the exploitation of Manchukuo while a former officer in the Kenpeitai talked about how he rounded up people for slave labour and ordered mass executions.[255]\\n\\nAt one point, Puyi was taken to Harbin and Pingfang to see where the infamous Unit 731, the chemical and biological warfare unit in the Japanese Army, had conducted gruesome experiments on people. Puyi noted in shame and horror: \"All the atrocities had been carried out in my name\".[255] Puyi by the mid-1950s was overwhelmed with guilt and often told Jin that he felt utterly worthless to the point that he considered suicide.[254] Jin told Puyi to express his guilt in writing. Puyi later recalled he felt \"that I was up against an irresistible force that would not rest until it found out everything\".[256]\\n\\nSometimes Puyi was taken out for tours of the countryside of Manchuria. On one, he met a farmer\\'s wife whose family had been evicted to make way for Japanese settlers and had almost starved to death while working as a slave in one of Manchukuo\\'s factories.[257] When Puyi asked for her forgiveness, she told him \"It\\'s all over now, let\\'s not talk about it\", causing him to break down in tears.[257] At another meeting, a woman described the mass execution of people from her village by the Japanese Army, and then declared that she did not hate the Japanese and those who had served them as she retained her faith in humanity, which greatly moved Puyi.[257] On another occasion, Jin confronted Puyi with his former concubine Li in meetings in his office, where she attacked him for seeing her only as a sex object, and saying she was now pregnant by a man who loved her.[257]\\n\\nSuez Crisis, playing the role of a left-wing Labour MP who challenges in the House of Commons a former Manchukuo minister playing the Foreign Secretary\\n\\nSelwyn Lloyd.\\n\\n[258]\\n\\n[259]\\n\\n[259]\\n\\nGreat Leap Forward, when millions of people starved to death in China, Jin chose to cancel Puyi\\'s visits to the countryside lest the scenes of famine undo his growing faith in communism.\\n\\n[260]\\n\\nbushido\\n\\n[261]\\n\\nRelease[edit]\\n\\nPuyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 with special permission from Mao and lived for the next six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel.[262] He had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: \"I\\'m Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty. I\\'m staying with relatives and can\\'t find my way home\".[263] One of Puyi\\'s first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist; he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth.[264] He voiced his support for the Communists and worked as a gardener at the Beijing Botanical Gardens. The role brought Puyi a degree of happiness he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy.[265]\\n\\nWilliam Joyce for being the announcer on the English-language broadcasts of\\n\\nRadio Berlin, the Italians shot\\n\\nBenito Mussolini, and the French executed\\n\\nPierre Laval, so many Westerners are surprised that Puyi was released from prison after only nine years to start a new life.\\n\\n[266]\\n\\n[266]\\n\\nIn early 1960, Puyi met Premier Zhou Enlai, who told him: \"You weren\\'t responsible for becoming Emperor at the age of three or the 1917 attempted restoration coup. But you were fully to blame for what happened later. You knew perfectly well what you were doing when you took refuge in the Legation Quarter, when you travelled under Japanese protection to Tianjin, and when you agreed to become Manchukuo Chief Executive.\"[265] Puyi responded by merely saying that though he did not choose to be an emperor, he had behaved with savage cruelty as boy-emperor and wished he could apologize to all the eunuchs he had flogged during his youth.[265]\\n\\nLi Shuxian, a hospital nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference.

I said nothing about my secret collaboration with the Japanese imperialists over a long period, an association to which my open capitulation after 18 September 1931 was but the conclusion. Instead, I spoke only of the way the Japanese had put pressure on me and forced me to do their will.\\nI maintained that I had not betrayed my country but had been kidnapped; denied all my collaboration with the Japanese; and even claimed that the letter I had written to Jirō Minami was a fake.[108] I covered up my crimes to protect myself.\\n\\nPuyi objected to Pujie\\'s attempt to reunite with Lady Saga, who had returned to Japan, writing to Zhou asking him to block Lady Saga from coming back to China, which led Zhou to reply: \"The war\\'s over, you know. You don\\'t have to carry this national hatred into your own family.\"[272] Behr concluded: \"It is difficult to avoid the impression that Puyi, in an effort prove himself a \\'remolded man\\', displayed the same craven attitude towards the power-holders of the new China that he had shown in Manchukuo towards the Japanese.\"[272]\\n\\nMany of the claims in From Emperor to Citizen, like the statement that it was the Kuomintang who stripped Manchuria bare of industrial equipment in 1945–46 rather than the Soviets, together with an \"unreservedly rosy picture of prison life\", are widely known to be false, but the book was translated into foreign languages and sold well. Behr wrote: \"The more fulsome, cliché-ridden chapters in From Emperor to Citizen, dealing with Puyi\\'s prison experiences, and written at the height of the Mao personality cult, give the impression of well-learned, regurgitated lessons.\"[273]\\n\\nFrom 1963 onward, Puyi regularly gave press conferences praising life in the People\\'s Republic of China, and foreign diplomats often sought him out, curious to meet the famous \"Last Emperor\" of China.[274] In an interview with Behr, Li Wenda told him that Puyi was a very clumsy man who \"invariably forgot to close doors behind him, forgot to flush the toilet, forgot to turn the tap off after washing his hands, had a genius for creating an instant, disorderly mess around him\".[275] Puyi had been so used to having his needs catered to that he never entirely learned how to function on his own.[275]\\n\\nHe tried very hard to be modest and humble, always being the last person to board a bus, which meant that on one occasion he missed the ride, mistaking the bus conductor for a passenger. In restaurants he would tell waitresses, \"You should not be serving me. I should be serving you.\"[275] During this period, Puyi was known for his kindness, and once after he accidentally knocked down an elderly lady with his bicycle, he visited her every day in the hospital to bring her flowers to make amends until she was released.[276]\\n\\nDeath[edit]\\n\\nCultural Revolution broke out in 1966, and the\\n\\nRed Guards that had been encouraged by Mao saw Puyi, who symbolised imperial China, as an easy target. Puyi was placed under protection by the local\\n\\npublic security bureau and, although his food rations, salary, and various luxuries, including his sofa and desk, were removed, he was not publicly humiliated as was common at the time. The Red Guards attacked Puyi for his book\\n\\n[277]\\n\\nZhou Enlai used his influence to protect Puyi and the rest of the Qing from the worst abuses inflicted by the Red Guard.\\n\\n[278]\\n\\nFushun for several years, while Li Wenda, who had ghostwritten\\n\\n[279]\\n\\n[280]\\n\\nIn accordance with the laws of the People\\'s Republic of China at the time, Puyi\\'s body was cremated. His ashes were first placed at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, alongside those of other party and state dignitaries. (This was the burial ground of imperial concubines and eunuchs prior to the establishment of the People\\'s Republic of China.) In 1995, as a part of a commercial arrangement, Puyi\\'s ashes were transferred by his widow Li Shuxian to the Hualong Imperial Cemetery (华龙皇家陵园)[281] in return for monetary support. The cemetery is near the Western Qing Tombs, 120\\xa0km (75\\xa0mi) southwest of Beijing, where four of the nine Qing emperors preceding him are interred, along with three empresses and 69 princes, princesses, and imperial concubines. In 2015, some descendants of the Aisin-Gioro clan bestowed posthumous names upon Puyi and his wives. Wenxiu and Li Yuqin were not given posthumous names as their imperial status was removed upon divorce.[282]\\n\\nTitles, honours, and decorations[edit]\\n\\nTitles[edit]\\n\\nStyles of Xuantong Emperor  Reference style His Imperial Majesty Spoken style Your Imperial Majesty Alternative style Son of Heaven\\n\\nsimplified Chinese:\\n\\n宣统皇帝;\\n\\ntraditional Chinese:\\n\\n宣統皇帝;\\n\\npinyin:\\n\\nXuāntǒng Huángdì\\n\\nWade–Giles:\\n\\nHsüan1-t\\'ung3 Huang2-ti4\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n末代皇帝;\\n\\npinyin:\\n\\nMòdài Huángdì\\n\\nWade–Giles:\\n\\nMo4-tai4 Huang2-ti4\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n清末帝;\\n\\npinyin:\\n\\nQīng Mò Dì\\n\\nWade–Giles:\\n\\nCh\\'ing1 Mo4-ti4\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n遜帝;\\n\\npinyin:\\n\\nXùn Dì\\n\\nsimplified Chinese:\\n\\n废帝;\\n\\ntraditional Chinese:\\n\\n廢帝;\\n\\npinyin:\\n\\nFèi Dì\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n清;\\n\\npinyin:\\n\\nQīng\\n\\nChinese:\\n\\n康德皇帝;\\n\\npinyin:\\n\\nKāngdé Huángdì\\n\\nJapanese:\\n\\nKōtoku Kōtei) during that period of time.\\n\\nHonours and decorations[edit]\\n\\nOrder of the Peacock Feather Order of the Blue Feather Order of the Double Dragon Order of the Imperial Throne Order of the Yellow Dragon Order of the Red Dragon Order of the Blue Dragon Order of the Black Dragon\\n\\nGrand Order of the Orchid Blossom Order of the Illustrious Dragon Order of the Auspicious Clouds Order of the Pillars of State\\n\\nSupreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation ( Italy ) Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus , 1st Class (Italy) Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy (Italy) Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (Japan) Order of the Paulownia Flowers (Japan) Order of Carol I ( Romania )\\n\\nFamily[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nFamily of Puyi\\n\\nPortrayal in media[edit]\\n\\nFilm[edit]\\n\\nThe Last Emperor, a 1986 Hong Kong film directed by Li Han-hsiang.

Thus,\\xa0solving AI alignment will\\xa0not necessarily lead to utopia.\\n\\nOthers have raised similar concerns before.[2]\\xa0Joe Carlsmith puts it especially well in the post “An even deeper atheism”:\\n\\n> “And now, of course, the question arises: how different, exactly, are\\xa0human hearts from each other? And in particular: are they sufficiently different that, when they foom, and even \"on reflection,\" they don\\'t end up pointing in exactly the same direction? After all, Yudkowsky said, above, that in order for the future to be non-trivially \"of worth,\" human hearts have to be in the driver\\'s seat. But even setting aside the insult, here, to the dolphins, bonobos, nearest grabby aliens, and so on – still, that\\'s only to specify a\\xa0necessary condition. Presumably, though, it\\'s not a sufficient condition? Presumably\\xa0some human hearts would be bad drivers, too? Like, I dunno, Stalin?”\\n\\n\\nWhat makes human hearts bad?\\xa0\\n\\nWhat, exactly, makes some human hearts bad drivers? If we better understood what makes hearts go bad, perhaps we could figure out how to make bad hearts good or at least learn how to prevent hearts from going bad. It would also allow us better spot potentially bad hearts and coordinate our efforts to prevent them from taking the driving seat.\\n\\nAs of now, I’m most worried about\\xa0malevolent\\xa0personality traits and\\xa0fanatical ideologies.[3]\\n\\nMalevolence: dangerous personality traits\\n\\nSome human hearts may be corrupted due to elevated\\xa0malevolent traits like psychopathy, sadism, narcissism, Machiavellianism, or spitefulness.\\n\\nIdeological fanaticism: dangerous belief systems\\n\\nThere are many suitable definitions of “ideological fanaticism”. Whatever definition we are going to use, it should describe ideologies that have caused immense harm historically, such as\\xa0fascism (Germany under Hitler, Italy under Mussolini), (extreme)\\xa0communism (the Soviet Union under Stalin, China under Mao),\\xa0religious fundamentalism (ISIS, the Inquisition), and most cults.\\xa0\\n\\nSee this footnote[4]\\xa0for a preliminary list of defining characteristics.\\n\\n\\nMalevolence and fanaticism seem especially dangerous\\n\\nOf course, there are other factors that could corrupt our hearts or driving ability. For example, cognitive biases, limited cognitive ability,\\xa0philosophical confusions, or plain old selfishness.[5]\\xa0I’m most concerned about malevolence and ideological fanaticism for two reasons.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nDeliberately resisting reflection and idealization\\n\\nFirst, malevolence—if reflectively endorsed[6]—and fanatical ideologies\\xa0deliberately resist being changed and would thus plausibly resist idealization even during a\\xa0long reflection. The most central characteristic of fanatical ideologies is arguably that they explicitly forbid criticism, questioning, and belief change and view doubters and disagreement as evil.\\xa0\\n\\nPutting positive value on creating harm\\n\\nSecond, malevolence and ideological fanaticism would not only result in the future not being as good as it possibly could—they might\\xa0actively steer the future in bad directions and, for instance, result in\\xa0astronomical amounts of suffering.\\xa0\\n\\nThe preferences of malevolent humans (e.g., sadists) may be such that they intrinsically enjoy inflicting suffering on others. Similarly, many fanatical ideologies sympathize with\\xa0excessive retributivism and often demonize the outgroup. Enabled by future technology, preferences for inflicting suffering on the outgroup may result in enormous disvalue—cf. concentration camps, the Gulag, or\\xa0hell[7].\\n\\nIn the future, I hope to write more about all of this, especially long-term risks from ideological fanaticism.\\xa0\\n\\nThanks to Pablo and Ruairi for comments and valuable discussions.\\xa0\\n\\n 1. ^\\n    \\n    “Human misalignment” is arguably a confusing (and perhaps confused) term. But it sounds more sophisticated than “bad human values”.\\xa0\\n\\n 2. ^\\n    \\n    For example, Matthew Barnett in “AI alignment shouldn\\'t be conflated with AI moral achievement”, Geoffrey Miller in “AI alignment with humans... but with which humans?”, lc in “Aligned AI is dual use technology”. Pablo Stafforini\\xa0has called this the “third alignment problem”. And of course, Yudkowsky’s concept of\\xa0CEV is meant to address these issues.\\xa0\\n\\n 3. ^\\n    \\n    These factors may not be clearly separable. Some humans may be more attracted to fanatical ideologies due to their psychological traits and malevolent humans are often leading fanatical ideologies. Also, believing and following a fanatical ideology may not be good for your heart.\\n\\n 4. ^\\n    \\n    Below are some typical characteristics (I’m no expert in this area):\\n    \\n    Unquestioning belief, absolute certainty and rigid adherence. The principles and beliefs of the ideology are seen as absolute truth and questioning or critical examination is forbidden.\\n    \\n    Inflexibility and refusal to compromise.\\xa0\\n    \\n    Intolerance and hostility towards dissent. Anyone who disagrees or challenges the ideology is seen as evil; as enemies, traitors, or heretics.\\n    \\n    Ingroup superiority and outgroup demonization. The in-group is viewed as superior, chosen, or enlightened. The out-group is often demonized and blamed for the world\\'s problems.\\xa0\\n    \\n    Authoritarianism. Fanatical ideologies often endorse (or even require) a strong, centralized authority to enforce their principles and suppress opposition, potentially culminating in dictatorship or totalitarianism.\\n    \\n    Militancy and willingness to use violence.\\n    \\n    Utopian vision. Many fanatical ideologies are driven by a vision of a perfect future or afterlife which can only be achieved through strict adherence to the ideology. This utopian vision often justifies extreme measures in the present.\\xa0\\n    \\n    Use of propaganda and censorship.\\xa0\\n\\n 5. ^\\n    \\n    For example, Barnett\\xa0argues that future technology will be primarily used to satisfy economic consumption (aka selfish desires). That seems even plausible to me, however, I’m not that concerned about this causing huge amounts of future suffering (at least compared to other s-risks). It seems to me that most humans place non-trivial value on the welfare of (neutral) others such as animals. Right now, this preference (for most people) isn’t strong enough to outweigh the selfish benefits of eating meat. However, I’m relatively hopeful that future technology would make such types of tradeoffs much less costly.\\xa0\\n\\n 6. ^\\n    \\n    Some people (how many?) with elevated malevolent traits don’t reflectively endorse their malevolent urges and would change them if they could. However, some of them do reflectively endorse their malevolent preferences and view empathy as weakness.\\xa0\\n\\n 7. ^\\n    \\n    Some quotes from famous Christian theologians:\\xa0\\n    \\n    Thomas Aquinas:\\xa0 \"the blessed will rejoice in the punishment of the wicked.\" \"In order that the happiness of the saints may be more delightful to them and that they may render more copious thanks to God for it, they are allowed to see perfectly the sufferings of the damned\".\\xa0\\n    \\n    Samuel Hopkins:\\xa0 \"Should the fire of this eternal punishment cease, it would in a great measure obscure the light of heaven, and put an end to a great part of the happiness and glory of the blessed.”\\n    \\n    Jonathan Edwards:\\xa0 \"The sight of hell torments will exalt the happiness of the saints forever.\"\\n\\n51\\n\\nLinch\\n\\n4d\\n\\nMy default story is one where government actors eventually take an increasing (likely dominant) role in the development of AGI. Some assumptions behind this default story:\\n\\n1. AGI progress continues to be fairly concentrated among a small number of actors, even as AI becomes percentage points of GDP.\\n\\n2. Takeoff speeds (from the perspective of the State) are relatively slow.\\n\\n3. Timelines are moderate to long (after 2030 say).\\xa0\\n\\nIf what I say is broadly correct, I think this may have has some underrated downstream implications For example, we may be currently overestimating the role of values or insitutional processes of labs, or the value of getting gov\\'ts to intervene(since the default outcome is that they\\'d intervene anyway). Conversely, we may be underestimating the value of clear conversations about AI that government actors or the general public can easily understand (since if they\\'ll intervene anyway, we want the interventions to be good). More speculatively, we may also be underestimating the value of making sure 2-3 are true (if you share my belief that gov\\'t actors will broadly be more responsible than the existing corporate actors).\\n\\nHappy to elaborate if this is interesting.\\n\\n31\\n\\nJohn Salter\\n\\n4d\\n\\nAI safety\\n\\nOpportunities\\n\\nExistential risk\\n\\nY-Combinator wants to fund Mechanistic Interpretability startups\\n\\n\"Understanding model behavior is very challenging, but we believe that in contexts where trust is paramount it is essential for an AI model to be interpretable.

At the slightest hint of danger, these resources should be distributed to every part of the country. There should be enough stock to protect the people for as long as is required to get resupplied.\\n\\nThe Australians have a national medical stockpile and they started distributing masks from it in January 2020 in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. The French used to have a national stockpile of masks, but they decided it would be more ‘efficient’ to get rid of it, reasoning that if there was an emergency, they could just buy masks from China. Sacre bleu!\\n\\nStockpiling is a general-purpose risk management technique which also works for other emergencies such as terrorism, fires, nuclear fallout, and war. If you want to survive in the long-run, you need to build stockpiles!\\n\\nLoad more\\n\\nPopular comments\\n\\nNew Open Philanthropy Grantmaking Program: Forecasting\\n\\nView in thread\\n\\nGrayden\\n\\n2d\\n\\n55\\n\\n32\\n\\nI think forecasting is attractive to many people in EA like myself because EA skews towards curious people from STEM backgrounds who like games. However, I’m yet to see a robust case for it being an effective use of charitable funds (if there is, please point me to it). I’m worried we are not being objective enough and trying to find the facts that support the conclusion rather than the other way round.\\n\\nCan we help individual people cost-effectively? Our trial with three sick kids\\n\\nView in thread\\n\\nsawyer\\n\\n2d\\n\\n30\\n\\nBuilding off of Jason\\'s comment: Another way to express this is that comparing directly to the $5,500 Givewell bar is only fair for risk-neutral donors (I think?). Most potential donors are not really risk neutral, and would rather spend $5,001 to definitely save one life than $5,000 to have a 10% chance of saving 10 lives. Risk neutrality is a totally defensible position, but so is non-neutrality. It\\'s good to have the option of paying a \"premium\" for a higher confidence (but lower risk-neutral EV).\\n\\nLeaving math mode...I love this post. It made me emotional and also made me think, and it feels like a really central example of what EA should be about. I\\'m very impressed by your resolve here in following through with this plan, and I\\'m really glad to have people like you in this community.\\n\\nSolution to the two envelopes problem for moral weights\\n\\nView in thread\\n\\nOwen Cotton-Barratt\\n\\n3d\\n\\n18\\n\\nRe. the scenario with the intelligent aliens, you argue that we just have access to different facts, so it\\'s unobjectionable that we reach different conclusions.\\n\\nBut the classic two-envelope problem is a problem because you get ~exploited. Offered a choice of two envelopes you pick one. And then when you open it you will predictably pay money to switch to the other envelope. Of course now you have extra facts — but that doesn\\'t change that it looks like a mistake to predictably have this behaviour.\\n\\nSimilarly in this case we could set up an (admittedly construed) situation where you start by doing a bunch of reasoning about what\\'s best, under a veil of ignorance about whether you\\'re human or alien. Then it\\'s revealed which you are, you remember all your experiences and can reason about how big a deal they are — and then you will predictably pay some utility in order to benefit the other species more. It similarly looks like it\\'s a mistake to predictably have this behaviour (in the sense that, if humans and aliens are equally likely to be put in this kind of construed situation, then the world would be predictably better off if nobody had this behaviour), and I don\\'t really feel like you\\'ve addressed this.\\n\\nIn the case of the classic two-envelope paradox the standard resolution is that you need to pay attention to your priors about how much money might be in envelopes. After you open your envelope and find $100, your probabilities of $50 vs $200 are no longer quite 50% — and for some values you could find, you should prefer not to switch.[1]\\n\\nSo in the case with the aliens, shouldn\\'t we similarly be discussing priors? Shouldn\\'t we be considering how much, on some kind of ur-prior, we should expect to experience, and then comparing what our actual experience is to that? And if we\\'re doing this in the case of aliens, shouldn\\'t we also do it in the case of chickens?\\n\\n 1. ^\\n    \\n    At least with tame priors. If your prior over the amount of money in the envelope has an infinite expectation, it\\'s possible for it to be always correct to switch. But in that case I imagine your complaint will be that you shouldn\\'t start with a prior with infinite expectation.\\n\\nLoad more\\n\\nRecent discussion\\n\\nVasco Grilo commented on New Open Philanthropy Grantmaking Program: Forecasting 3m ago\\n\\n84New Open Philanthropy Grantmaking Program: ForecastingOpen Philanthropy+ 0 more · 3d\\xa0ago · 2m read22\\n\\nThis is a linkpost for https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-grantmaking-program-forecasting/\\n\\nWritten by\\n\\nBenjamin Tereick\\n\\nWe are happy to announce that we have added\\n\\nforecasting as an official grantmaking\\n\\nfocus area.

For context, readers may want to check the question post Why is EA so enthusiastic about forecasting?.Reply\\n\\n4MaxRa4hI agree that things like confirmation bias and myside bias are huge drivers impeding \"societal sanity\". And I also agree that it won\\'t help a lot here to develop tools to refine probabilities slightly more.\\n\\nThat said, I think there is a huge crowd of reasonably sane people who have never interacted with the idea of quantified forecasting as a useful epistemic practice and a potential ideal to thrive towards when talking about important future developments. Like other commentators say, it\\'s currently mostly attracting a niche of people who thrive for higher epistemic ideals, who try to contribute to better forecasts on important topics, etc. I currently feel like it\\'s not intractable for quantitative forecasts to become more common in epistemic spaces filled with reasonable enough people (e.g. journalism, politics, academia). Kinda similar to how tracking KPIs where probably once a niche new practice and are now standard practice.\\n\\n4MaxRa4hThanks, I think that\\'s a good question. Some (overlapping) reasons that come to mind that I give some credence to:\\n\\na) relevant markets are simply making an error in neglecting quantified forecasts\\n\\n * e.g. COVID was an example where I remember some EA adjacent people making money because investors were underrating the pandemic potential signifiantly\\n * I personally find it plausible when looking e.g. at the quality of think tank reports which seems significantly curtailed due to the amount of vague propositions that would be much more useful if more concrete and quantified\\n\\nb) relevant players train the relevant skills sufficiently well into their employees themselves (e.g. that\\'s my fairly uninformed impression from what Jane Street is doing, and maybe also Bridgewater?)\\n\\nc) quantified forecasts are so uncommon that it still feels unnatural to most people to communicate them, and it feels cumbersome to be nailed down on giving a number if you are not practiced in it\\n\\nd) forecasting is a nerdy practice, and those practices need bigger wins to be adopted (e.g. maybe similar to learning programming/math/statistics, working with the internet, etc.)\\n\\ne) maybe more systematically I\\'m thinking that it\\'s often not in the interest of entrenched powers to have forecasters call bs on whatever they\\'re doing.\\n\\n * in corporate hierarchies people in power prefer the existing credentialism, and oppose new dimensions of competition\\n * in other arenas there seems to be a constant risk of forecasters raining on your parade\\n\\nf) maybe previous forecast-like practices (\"futures studies\", \"scenario planning\") maybe didn\\'t yield many benefits and made companies unexited about similar practices (I personally have a vague sense of not being impressed by things I\\'ve seen associated with these words)\\n\\nRethink Priorities commented on Who\\'s hiring?

I realize that I really wasn\\'t clear, and that it probably does exist more in EA than my instinctive impression (also - great links, I hadn\\'t been familiar with all of them).\\n\\nWhat I meant by leverage was more along the lines of \"the value of insider\\'s perspective and the ability to leverage individual networks and skill sets\". In these cases, Nick was able to identify potential cost-effective ways to save lives because of both his training and location, and SACH is able to similarly have a cost-effective program because of their close connections with a hospital. I have a few other examples as well, such as NALA\\'s WASH on Wheel\\'s program (which essentially trains a team a plumbers and provides access to clean water to hundreds of program, leveraging the existing infrastructure), and anecdotes I\\'ve heard about people on the ground being able to provide crucial solutions during the current Israel-Hamas crisis.\\n\\nI have a sense that the classic EA (and I could very much be strawmanning here) thinks along the lines of: big problems, good solutions, niche area - but doesn\\'t think about who is best placed to identify or implement even better solutions that can come up because the world is messy.\\n\\nAfter thinking about it, the \"leverage\" I\\'m referring to is probably more common than I thought, but maybe not so very well defined.\\n\\n1ezrah10hFrom what I understand, the per-patient treatments costs are both quite low and are given pro-bono, so given how GiveWell understands leverage (which @Mo Putera pointed out in the response below), they should be strongly discounted from the costs. The question of how to incorporate the infrastructure costs, ie - the hospital, staff training, etc - that enable the program to operate, is quite interesting, and I honestly don\\'t have a great idea how that fits into the model.\\n\\nAdam Binks commented on Let\\'s advertise EA infrastructure projects, Feb 2024 1h ago73Let\\'s advertise EA infrastructure projects, Feb 2024Arepo+ 0 more · 1d\\xa0ago · 5m read11This is the latest of a theoretically-three-monthly series of posts advertising EA infrastructure projects that struggle to get and maintain awareness (see original advertising post for more on the rationale).I italicise organisations added since the previous post was originally...Continue readingAdam Binks1h100As well as Fatebook for Slack, at Sage we\\'ve made other infrastructure aimed at EAs (amongst others!):Fatebook: the fastest way to make and track predictionsFatebook for Chrome: Instantly make and embed predictions, in Google Docs and anywhere else on the webQuantified Intuitions: Practice assigning credences to outcomes with a quick feedback loopReply\\n\\nDaniel Abiliba posted African Heads of States Ban Donkey Skin Trade 1h ago7African Heads of States Ban Donkey Skin TradeDaniel Abiliba, Jacob Ayang + 0 more · 1h\\xa0ago · 1m read0This is a linkpost for https://www.animalwelfareleague.org/blog/ban-donkey-skin-trade-by-african-heads-of-statesAfrican Union Heads of State, during their gathering in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the 37th Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly, successfully placed a ban on the Donkey skin trade following the proposal that was made by the Specialised Technical Committee for Agriculture, Rural Development, Water, and Environment in November 2023.Continue reading\\n\\nJanet Pauketat posted AI Policy Insights from the AIMS Survey 1h ago5AI Policy Insights from the AIMS SurveyJanet Pauketat, Justin Bullock+ 0 more · 1h\\xa0ago · 21m read0This is a linkpost for https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/ai-policy-insights-from-the-aims-surveyEdited by Jacy Reese Anthis, Spencer Case, and Michael Dello-Iacovo. Thanks to Christopher DiCarlo and Elliot McKernon for their insights.AbstractThe accelerating development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has raised widespread concerns about risks from advanced AI. This poses important questions for policymakers regarding appropriate governance strategies to address these risks. However, effective policy requires understanding public attitudes and priorities regarding AI risks and interventions. In this blog post, we summarize key AI policy insights from the\\xa0Artificial Intelligence, Morality and Sentience (AIMS) survey to elucidate public opinion on pivotal AI safety issues.Insights include:\\xa0High concern about the fast pace of AI development;\\xa0Expectation of artificial general intelligence (AGI) within 5 years;\\xa0Widespread concern about AI catastrophic and existential...Continue reading\\n\\nSign up for the weekly EA Forum DigestA curated reading list of Forum posts, every Wednesday\\n\\nResources\\n\\nThe EA Handbook\\n\\nThe Introductory EA Program\\n\\nDiscover EA groups\\n\\nOpportunities\\n\\nUpcoming EA conferences in 2024\\n\\nPosted \\n\\n9h\\xa0ago\\n\\nCLR Summer Research Fellowship 2024\\n\\nPosted \\n\\n7d\\xa0ago\\n\\nAt Our World in Data we\\'re hiring a Junior Data Scientist\\n\\nPosted \\n\\n1d\\xa0ago\\n\\nUpcoming events\\n\\nImpactful Careers in US Policy\\n\\nFeb 23\\n\\nOnline\\n\\nNot the End of the World Reading Group\\n\\nFeb 25\\n\\nOnline\\n\\nAntimicrobial Resistance: Too many bugs, not enough drugs\\n\\nFeb 28\\n\\nOnline\\n\\nListen to posts anywhere\\n\\nListen onSpotify\\n\\nListen onApple Podcasts\\n\\nListen onPocket Casts\\n\\nListen onPodcast Addict\\n\\nSend feedback', metadata={'source': 'https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/', 'title': 'Effective Altruism Forum', 'description': \"Research, discussion, and updates on the world's most pressing problems.
