      "(NEXSTAR) — The sun has been active over the last few days, prompting solar radiation events, a strong flare event, and now, multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which could bring the northern lights to part of the U.S. this week.\n",
      "As overwhelming as those terms may sound, these are normal activities for the sun, especially during the phase it’s in now: Solar Cycle 25.\n",
      "Solar cycles are 11-year periods when the sun flips its magnetic poles, sparking space weather such as flares and CMEs, which are explosions of plasma and magnetic material from the sun that can reach Earth in as little as 15 to 18 hours, NOAA explains. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) reported last month that we’re nearing the peak of the current solar cycle.\n",
      "As part of that, we can expect to see the activities the SWPC has been monitoring over the last few days. Last week, the SWPC detected multiple flares on the sun, which can impact those using high-frequency radio signals though doesn’t largely impact the general public.\n",
      "On Friday, the SWPC reported a minor solar radiation storm event, which the agency warned is “not unusual” and only brought minor impacts to those using high-frequency radios and “possible slight risk to space launch.” Later that day, the agency reported a polar cap absorption (PCA) event was underway that, again, only posed a possible impact to those using high-frequency communication in the polar regions.\n",
      "On Sunday, the SWPC issued a geomagnetic storm watch that will last through Wednesday due to the chance that “multiple CMEs may arrive at Earth and lead to increased geomagnetic activity.”\n",
      "According to NASA, CMEs can create currents in Earth’s magnetic fields that send particles to the North and South Poles. When those particles interact with oxygen and nitrogen, they can create northern lights.\n",
      "“It’s essentially the sun shooting a magnet out into space,” Bill Murtagh, program coordinator for the SWPC and seasoned space weather forecaster, previously told Nexstar. “That magnet impacts Earth’s magnetic field and we get this big interaction.”\n",
      "That interaction is known as a geomagnetic storm. The strength of the storm will impact how far south the northern lights will be visible.\n",
      "To signify the strength of geomagnetic storms, the SWPC uses a 5-point scale. At the lowest end is G1, which is described as minor storms that can lead to aurora being visible in Maine and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. A G5 storm, described as extreme, could send the northern lights into the southern U.S.\n",
      "Through Wednesday, the SWPC says, CMEs are likely to cause G1 to G2-level geomagnetic storm conditions. These aren’t uncommon: a G2 moderate geomagnetic storm impacted Earth last month after an eruption of solar material was detected.\n",
      "While there are no concerns to the general public when it comes to these storms, there is a chance for those in the northern portions of the U.S. to see the northern lights.\n",
      "Based on the current forecasting from the SWPC, it seems the best chance for the northern U.S. to catch the aurora is Monday night. The map on the left below shows Monday’s forecast. Areas in red have the greatest likelihood of seeing the aurora, while those in the green have the lowest likelihood. Those living as far south as the red line on the map still have the possibility of seeing the northern lights if they look toward the northern horizon.\n",
      "The aurora forecast for Monday, Feb. 12, 2024, as of Monday morning. (NOAA SWPC)\n",
      "The aurora forecast for Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2024, as of Monday morning. (NOAA SWPC)\n",
      "Alaska and much of Canada have the greatest chance of seeing the aurora on both Monday and Tuesday, as they usually do thanks to their proximity to the North Pole. Fourteen states are at or above the view line, meaning they do have at least a slim chance of seeing the aurora Monday. Those states include Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, northern Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n",
      "Tuesday’s forecast, seen on the map to the right above, shows the likelihood of the aurora lighting up the night sky is slimmer, even for Alaska and Canada. Some northern states could, however, still get a glimpse at the northern lights. States at or above the view line include Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and northern Maine.\n",
      "As you can tell, the further north you are, the greater chance you have of seeing the aurora when it glows.\n",
      "If you live further south, say in Texas or Florida, you’ll need a much stronger geomagnetic storm event to have a chance at the northern lights.\n",
      "According to the SWPC’s scale, a minor G1 storm leads to aurora commonly being visible in Maine and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. A moderate G2 storm can bring the northern lights slightly southward into New York and Idaho.\n",
      "When a storm reaches G3 status, the aurora can be viewed as far south as Illinois and Oregon. Should it reach G4 strength, those living in Alabama and northern California may have a chance at seeing the northern lights. Solar activity that causes a G5 storm, the highest possible on SWPC’s scale, has been known to make aurora appear in Florida and even southern Texas.\n",
      "If you live in a southern state such as Florida, Texas, or even Hawaii, in addition to a G4 or G5 storm, you’ll also need a few other pieces to align perfectly, according to Murtagh. That includes the storm impacting Earth around 8 or 9 p.m. (so you can actually see the lights), a clear sky, and a view away from light pollution caused by cities and towns.\n",
      "More severe geomagnetic storms are rarer, though. A G1 storm, for example, can happen 1,700 times per solar cycle (more on that later), or about 900 days per 11 years. A G5 strength storm may only happen about four times during a solar cycle.\n",

       "[Document(page_content=\"Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down in the Kremlin for a two-hour interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, pushing his views on the justification for the nearly 2-year-old war in Ukraine, the prospects of peace talks, and other issues. He also touched on the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, an American journalist for The Wall Street Journal, who is charged with espionage,\\nA look at some key quotes from Putin, supplying context and background:\\nPUTIN'S QUOTE: “It was they who started the war in 2014. Our goal is to stop this war. And we did not start this war in 2022. This is an attempt to stop it.”\\nTHE CONTEXT: This statement refers to the violence in Ukraine that was sparked by the 2014 ouster of the Moscow-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, amid mass anti-government demonstrations in Kyiv. Russia responded by illegally annexing the Crimea region of Ukraine, and fighting broke out in the country's industrial east, where pro-Moscow separatists said they were trying to protect the Russian-speaking population.\\nWhen Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Ukraine and its Western allies described it as an unprovoked act of aggression. Putin said Moscow was forced to act preemptively to stop Ukraine from joining NATO and prevent a large-scale offensive by Kyiv aimed at reclaiming those eastern regions. Russia has provided no evidence that any such operation was in the making.\\nPUTIN'S QUOTE: “We haven’t achieved our aims yet, because one of them is denazification. This means the prohibition of all kinds of neo-Nazi movements.”\\nTHE CONTEXT: Russian propagandists have repeatedly sought to portray Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a neo-Nazi or Nazi sympathizer, even though he is Jewish and has said three of his grand-uncles died in the Holocaust. Putin has offered no proof to back his repeated claims that radical, ultranationalist groups in Ukraine influence Zelenskyy and have a decisive voice in shaping the country’s policies.\\nPUTIN'S QUOTE: “As soon as we pulled back our troops from Kyiv, Ukrainian negotiators immediately threw all the agreements reached in Istanbul into the bin and got prepared for a longstanding armed confrontation with the help of the United States and its satellites in Europe.”\\nTHE CONTEXT: Russian and Ukrainian officials negotiated a tentative peace deal in Istanbul in March 2022, a month after the start of the invasion, but it quickly collapsed. While Russia has portrayed the withdrawal of its troops from areas near Kyiv as a sign of goodwill, the Kremlin clearly was forced to retreat due to heavy losses and logistical problems while trying to capture the Ukrainian capital.\\nPUTIN'S QUOTE: “We haven’t rejected negotiations.”\\nTHE CONTEXT: While insisting that Russia is open for talks, the Kremlin has maintained a tough negotiating stand, saying Ukraine will need to accept the gains Russia has made in eastern and southern parts of the country. Ukraine, for its part, says no talks are possible until Russia's complete withdrawal from occupied areas. In September 2022, Moscow illegally annexed the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, to go with its seizure of Crimea.\\nPUTIN'S QUOTE: “He was caught red-handed when he was secretly getting classified information.”\\nTHE CONTEXT: Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, was arrested in March 2023 on espionage charges and has been in jail ever since, pending his trial. Gershkovich and the Journal deny the allegations, and the U.S. government says he has been wrongfully detained. Russian authorities haven’t released any of the evidence Putin cited to support the charges. Putin also suggested that a prisoner swap was possible.\", metadata={'source': 'Some of what Putin told Tucker Carlson missed the bigger picture ...', 'title': 'https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-told-tucker-carlson-missed-bigger-picture-fills-107111440'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='US media personality Tucker Carlson’s hotly anticipated interview with Vladimir Putin was billed as a unique opportunity to challenge Western perceptions of the war in Ukraine and hear Russia’s side of the story. Instead, Putin hijacked the spectacle to underline his status as the world’s most dangerous amateur historian.\\nThe interview began in predictable fashion with Carlson inviting Putin to blame NATO and the US for the ongoing invasion. However, it was soon apparent that the Russian leader had something very different in mind.\\nSidestepping Carlson’s opening question, Putin launched into a rambling half-hour lecture covering more than a thousand years of Russian and Ukrainian history that placed the roots of today’s war firmly in the distant past. His core message was chillingly simple: Ukraine has no right to exist and he is fully justified in waging a war of aggression to reclaim historically Russian lands.\\nCarlson admitted to being initially shocked and annoyed by this monologue, but eventually concluded that Putin’s insistence on articulating his historic claims to Ukraine was actually “a sincere expression of what he thinks.” This seems a fair assessment. Putin’s obsession with history is well known, as is his conviction that Ukrainians are in fact Russians. Indeed, anyone who has listened to Putin’s many public statements on the topic of Ukraine or read his 2021 essay on the “historical unity” of Russians and Ukrainians will have been more than familiar with the content of his latest lecture.\\nWhile Putin has often been accused of weaponizing history, it was nonetheless revealing that he should choose to prioritize his historical grievances in such a setting. After all, this was the Russian president’s first major interaction with the Western press since the start of the Ukraine invasion almost two years ago. Tucker Carlson had been handpicked for the occasion, having won the trust of Moscow officials via years of pro-Kremlin messaging in the US media.\\nThe interview was viewed by many within the Putin regime as a rare chance for Russia to make its case on its own terms to a truly global audience. Unfortunately for the Kremlin, things did not go according to plan. Rather than coming away convinced by the rationality of Putin’s arguments, many viewers were left bewildered by his arcane references to medieval princes and seventeenth century diplomatic correspondence.\\nStay updated\\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\\nNeedless to say, much of Putin’s lecture was complete nonsense that echoed longstanding Russian imperial myths while conveniently overlooking Ukraine’s centuries of documented history. In his traditional manner, Putin ridiculed Ukraine as an illegitimate and artificial state. He dismissed the entire notion of a separate Ukrainian nation, calling it an anti-Russian conspiracy involving everyone from the Poles and the Pope to the Austrian General Staff.\\nThese claims owe more to Kremlin propaganda than any actual academic rigor. In reality, the term “Ukraine” first appeared in the twelfth century, while Ukraine’s statehood struggle can be traced back more than three hundred years. As long ago as 1731, French thinker Voltaire was moved to write, “Ukraine has always aspired to be free.”\\nPutin’s insistence that southern and eastern Ukraine are historically Russian is similarly unsupported by the available evidence. The 1897 census conducted by the Czarist authorities, which provides the most reliable guide to the demographic makeup of the Russian Empire, identified Ukrainian-speaking majorities throughout much of today’s southern and eastern Ukraine, as well as in a number of regions that are now part of Russia.\\nLikewise, Putin’s assertion that Lenin and Stalin created modern Ukraine ignores the inconvenient fact that the short-lived Ukrainian People’s Republic had already existed for a number of years before the early Bolsheviks were finally able to extinguish this fledgling Ukrainian state and impose Soviet rule.\\nMany more of Putin’s statements have since been comprehensively debunked by everyone from the BBC and TIME magazine to the diplomats of the Polish Foreign Ministry, who were understandably outraged by the Russian leader’s attempt to justify Adolf Hitler’s 1939 invasion of Poland. As Carlson himself showed little interest in challenging Putin, these fact-checking efforts are particularly important.\\nAt the same time, the real takeaway from the interview was Putin’s apparently genuine belief that his antiquated historical arguments could serve as plausible justification for a major war in twenty-first century Europe. This is perhaps the clearest indication yet of the dangerous delusions and imperial ambitions that led Putin to invade Ukraine.\\nPutin is no stranger to openly imperialistic rhetoric, of course. For years, he has subjected domestic audiences to long sermons detailing Russia’s historic grievances and the injustices of the post-Soviet settlement. Ukraine has always been the main focus of this revanchist zeal.\\nAs his grip on power has tightened, Putin has grown increasingly fixated with the idea of reasserting Russian authority over Ukraine, and has come to view this as his historic mission. On the eve of the full-scale invasion two years ago, he described Ukraine as “an inalienable part of our own history, culture, and spiritual space.” In summer 2022, Putin directly compared the current war to the imperial conquests of eighteenth century Russian Czar Peter the Great and claimed to be “returning” historically Russian lands.\\nEurasia Center events\\nUnless Putin is defeated in Ukraine, it is fanciful to imagine that he will voluntarily abandon his increasingly aggressive brand of historical revisionism. On the contrary, it is far more likely that other countries will also fall victim to the Russian ruler’s expanding imperial ambitions. Naturally, Putin assured Tucker Carlson that he has no such intentions, but he has issued similar denials prior to each new stage of his escalating Ukraine invasion. At this point, the most logical conclusion is that he will not stop until he is stopped.\\nHow far could Putin go? Throughout his reign, he has consistently lamented the fall of the USSR, which he has referred to as the demise of “historical Russia.” After the events of the past two years, it should be painfully apparent that anywhere Putin regards as “historical Russia” is potentially at risk.\\nIn theory, at least, the same bogus historical arguments that have been used to justify the invasion of Ukraine could easily be applied to other parts of the former Soviet Union, or to the Russian Empire of the Czarist era. This would create an array of possible targets for Russian aggression including Finland, Poland, the Baltic states, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Alaska, and the whole of Central Asia. A maximalist interpretation could even see all of Central Europe’s former Soviet satellite states besides Poland added to the list.\\nIn today’s increasingly unstable geopolitical climate, talk of further Russian invasions can no longer be dismissed as alarmist. Mounting signs of Western weakness in Ukraine have visibly emboldened Putin, and may yet tempt him to test NATO’s resolve in a more direct manner. He has already succeeded in shifting the Russian economy onto a war footing, and is cranking up arms manufacturing at a rate that far outpaces the West. Even now, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine still very much undecided, it is all-too-easy to imagine waking up to social media posts labeling Kazakhstan an “artificial country” or proclaiming Estonia “historically Russian” as Putin’s tanks roll across the border.\\nAs the tenth anniversary of Russia’s war in Ukraine draws close, Putin’s interview with Tucker Carlson should serve as a wake-up call for the collective West. A decade ago, Putin began his attack on Ukraine by occupying Crimea. At first, he acted with a degree of caution, officially denying any role in the military takeover of the Ukrainian peninsula and orchestrating a fig leaf referendum to disguise the crime. Ten years on, Putin now feels confident enough to sit down with one of the world’s most famous journalists and defend the invasion of a major European country by claiming it is rightfully his. Anyone who still believes he would not dare attack NATO is only fooling themselves.\\nPutin’s history obsession would be comical if the consequences were not so tragic. Using ancient dynasties and long forgotten treaties to justify the biggest European conflict since World War II is indeed farcical, and has duly inspired a flood of memes mocking the Kremlin dictator as a man completed detached from reality. But as we chuckle at Putin the ultimate history bore, he will continue distorting the past to shape the future. At present, there is a very real danger he will have the last laugh.\\nPeter Dickinson is editor of the Atlantic Council’s UkraineAlert service.\\nFurther reading\\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\\nThe Eurasia Center’s mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.\\nFollow us on social media and support our work\\nImage: Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during an interview with U.S. television host Tucker Carlson in Moscow, Russia February 6, 2024.

       " Document(page_content='* LW,\\nActualizado 08/02/2024 - 18:43 CST\\nThe Vladimir Putin interiew on Tucker Carlson is finally here and the establishment media is outraged at the discussion the rogue Americna journalist had with the Russian president. They spoke about politics, yes. But they also discussed different topics that offered a less filtered perspectiv into Vladimir Putin\\'s mind. Carlson did mention that Putin wasn\\'t happy with some parts of the line of questioning against him. Despite this disagreement, the interview extended for over two hours and we will let you judge the result of it. Tucker had an introduction to the long interview where he claims he feels Vladimir Putin was sincere.\\nPutin praises Elon Musk but issues a warning\\nPerhaps one of the most revealing aspects of the interview was when Tucker Carlson asked Putin about Elon Musk\\'s new brain chip technology called Neuralink. The Russian president seemed extremely careful in how he phrased his response. This is what he said: \"I think there\\'s no stopping Elon Musk. He will do as he sees fit. Nevertheless, you\\'ll need to find some common ground with him. Search for ways to persuade him. I think he\\'s a smart person. I truly believe he is. So you\\'ll need to reach an agreement with him because this process needs to be formalized and subjected to certain rules.\"\\nOther claims Puting made will be extremely more scrutinized such as the two times he was rejected by two sitting presidents. He claims he asked Bill Clinton if it was possible for Russia to join NATO during one of his visits and the president said no after consulting his advisers. In a different visit, Putin claims he proposed to jointly construct the missile defense system with the U.S. but the American government denied his request again. By this point, Putin claims he believed the United States wasn\\'t interested in cooperating with Russia. Putin\\'s profile is also impeachable, there is no question about it. But watching this interview will allow for smart people to read his responses and tell if he is being sincere or not. You can watch the full interview in full both on X and on Tucker Carlson\\'s website.

Tusupbekov\\'s whereabouts are unknown.\\nThe developments come less than one month after Kazakh authorities unexpectedly allowed an event commemorating the 80th anniversary of the birth of the late opposition politician Zamanbek Nurqadilov, an outspoken critic of Nazarbaev.\\nOn January 14, a special letter from Toqaev praising Nurqadilov\\'s contribution to Kazakh statehood was read at the ceremony to commemorate him. The event was unusual because, since Nurqadilov\\'s death, any public mention of the politician\\'s name and his apparent assassination had been taboo.\\nNurqadilov was mayor of Almaty and chairman of the Emergency Situations Agency before he turned into a fierce critic of Nazarbaev and his government in 2004. He was found dead with two bullets in his chest and one in his head at his home in Almaty. Official investigators ruled that the death was a suicide, sparking a public outcry at the time.\\nThree months later Sarsenbaiuly and his associates -- driver Vasily Zhuravlyov, and assistant Bauyrzhan Baibosyn -- were assassinated. The killings were officially declared to have been motivated by personal enmity.\\nAnother defendant in the Sarsenbaiuly case, former chief of staff of the Kazakh parliament Erzhan Otembaev, was convicted of ordering the slaying and sentenced to 20 years in prison. However, in 2013, Otembaev\\'s sentence was annulled after Kazakh authorities announced that the case had been sent for review based on newly obtained evidence, which they said indicated that Aliev had ordered the killing.\\nAliev, who was deputy chief of Kazakhstan’s National Security Committee when the slayings took place and later became an outspoken opponent of his former father-in-law, was in self-imposed exile in Europe at the time.\\nHe was later arrested by Austrian officials at the request of authorities in Kazakhstan who accused him of involvement in the kidnapping and murder of two Kazakh bankers.\\nIn February 2015, Aliev was found hanged in a Vienna jail.\\nAustrian officials ruled that Aliev\\'s death was a suicide, but many in Kazakhstan believe he was murdered while in Austrian custody.\\nWith reporting by Zlobnaya Tateshka and RFE/RL\\'s Kazakh Service', metadata={'source': 'Former Fox News Commentator Tucker Carlson Says He Will ...', 'title': 'https://www.rferl.org/a/fox-news-tucker-carlson-interview-putin/32808118.html'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Tucker Carlson had a curious defense of Vladimir Putin in his first interview since interviewing the Russian autocrat, saying “Every leader kills people, leadership requires killing.”\\nCarlson’s remarks were made at the 2024 World Government Summit in Dubai, where he was interviewed by Egyptian journalist Emad Eldin Adeeb.\\nAdeeb asked Carlson why he neglected to ask Putin about such pressing topics as the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. “I’m not going to lecture you, but you should challenge some ideas,” said Adeeb. “You did not talk about freedom of speech, you did not talk about Navlny...”\\nCarlson replied that other journalists had already posed such questions to Putin, adding, essentially, that it’s not news that Putin has ordered hits on his enemies. “Every leader kills people, leadership requires killing,” said the former Fox News anchor. (Carlson’s comments that “leadership requires killing” appear about 17 minutes into the 26-minute segment.)\\nAlthough Carlson did ask Putin about the potential release of detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich during the interview that took place in Moscow, he told Adeeb that his primary goal was to “let Putin talk” and “hear his thoughts.” Carlson said that positioning himself as the “good guy” to Putin’s “bad guy” would “not be fruitful.”\\nWhen Adeeb asked about Carlson’s response to the criticism leveled at him over his Putin interview, Carlson responded,”I don’t like the internet and I haven’t seen any of the reactions.” Adeeb asked specifically if Carlson had heard Hillary Clinton’s summation that he had proved “a useful idiot” to the Russian dictator and he claimed not to have heard about it.\\n“She’s a child, I don’t listen to her,” he said of the former Secretary of State.\\nWhile Carlson insisted several times that he is “not flakking for Putin,” he did praise Moscow for being better than any current U.S. city. “Moscow is so much nicer than any city in my country, cleaner and safer and prettier. I grew up in a country that had cities like Moscow and Abu Dhabi, and Singapore and Tokyo, and we no longer have them.”\\nDecrying the “filth and graffiti” found in American cities and people “begging for drugs” in London, Carlson seemed to be saying that if he were in charge, those kinds of things would not happen: “My children don’t smoke marijuana at the breakfast table because I don’t allow them.”\\nCarlson also has a long history of supporting pro-Putin and pro-Russia talking points on issues like the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine or U.S.-Russia relations, and criticizing Putin’s enemies and people arrested and imprisoned by Russia.\\nThe post Tucker Carlson Defends Putin, Says ‘Leadership Requires Killing’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.', metadata={'source': \"Tucker Carlson Defends Putin, Says 'Leadership Requires Killing ...\", 'title': 'https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tucker-carlson-defends-putin-says-022049023.html'})]"
